# Brand Architecture: Three-Layer Strategy

> Date: 2026-02-10
> Status: Active
> Core principle: vibeorg.com = category creation and education

---

## Overview

OpenVibe's brand is structured in three layers, each serving a different purpose:

1. **vibeorg.com** - Movement, category creation, partner recruitment
2. **open-vibe.org** - Technical infrastructure, developer community
3. **vibe.us** - Commercial product, sales

**The strategy**: Lead with category creation (vibeorg.com), validate with open source (open-vibe.org), convert with product (vibe.us).

---

## Layer 1: Movement (vibeorg.com)

**Purpose**: Define the category, educate the market, recruit partners

### Target Audience
- C-suite executives (CEO, CTO, COO)
- Thought leaders and innovators
- Potential partners (consulting, accounting, MSPs)
- Media and analysts
- Organizations asking "how do we transform?"

### Key Message
**Headline**: "Vibe your organization"
**Subline**: "The workspace where humans and agents work as a team"
**Meaning**: Transform how your organization works — where AI becomes a colleague, not just a tool.

### Content Strategy

**Category Education**:
- **What is "Vibing"?** → Manifesto explaining the shift from AI-as-tool to AI-as-colleague
- **Why now?** → The transition is happening (5K-15K orgs already operating this way)
- **How to Vibe** → Framework: Protocol (for agents) + Interface (for humans) + Space (shared)

**Methodology**:
- The Vibe Framework (open methodology, not product-specific)
- Best practices for human+agent collaboration
- Trust levels, SOUL configs, feedback loops (concepts, not features)
- Case studies: organizations already Vibing

**Partner Ecosystem**:
- Partner directory (by industry/region)
- "Find a Vibe Partner" search
- Partner success stories
- Apply to be a partner

**Community**:
- Blog (thought leadership, customer stories, partner stories)
- Events (webinars, conferences, meetups)
- Newsletter (weekly insights, case studies)

### Tone
Inspirational, visionary, community-driven. Not salesy. Not technical.

**Examples**:
- "The AI that was in your last meeting — and every meeting before that"
- "Where your team works, and the workspace learns"
- "Few humans, many agents, one workspace"

### Traffic Sources
- Content marketing (thought leadership articles)
- Speaking events, conferences
- Partner co-marketing
- PR, media coverage
- Social media (LinkedIn, Twitter/X)

### Conversion Goals
1. **Join the movement** → Newsletter signup
2. **Become a partner** → Partner application
3. **Try the product** → Link to vibe.us (free trial)
4. **Explore the tech** → Link to open-vibe.org (docs, GitHub)

**NOT a product site.** If someone wants to buy, send them to vibe.us.

## Layer 2: Open Source (open-vibe.org)

**Purpose**: Technical documentation, developer community, open source project

### Target Audience
- Developers and engineers
- Technical evaluators (architects, CTOs)
- Open source contributors
- Self-hosted users
- Organizations evaluating infrastructure

### Key Message
"Open infrastructure for human+agent collaboration"

### Content Strategy

**Documentation**:
- Getting started (installation, deployment)
- Architecture (system design, diagrams, principles)
- API reference (tRPC endpoints, database schema)
- Integration guides (models, tools, data sources)
- Self-hosting guide (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)

**GitHub**:
- Link to github.com/openvibeorg
- Contribution guide
- Issue tracker
- Roadmap

**Community**:
- Developer Discord
- Community forum (discussions, Q&A)
- Showcase (community projects, plugins, agents)

### Tone
Technical, transparent, collaborative. Docs-first, not marketing.

### Traffic Sources
- GitHub, developer communities
- Technical blogs, documentation
- Open source directories (GitHub Trending, Product Hunt)
- Developer conferences
- Search (technical queries like "self-hosted team AI workspace")

### Conversion Goals
1. **Star GitHub repo**
2. **Deploy self-hosted version**
3. **Contribute to open source**
4. **Some convert to vibe.us** (managed hosting for convenience)

---

## Layer 3: Commercial Product (vibe.us)

**Purpose**: Product sales, customer acquisition, revenue

### Target Audience
- Buyers (teams, organizations)
- End users (team members)
- Decision makers (CTO, COO, CFO)
- Partners deploying for clients

### Key Message
"Vibe AI Workspace — Gets smarter every day"

### Content Strategy

**Product**:
- Features (agents, memory, feedback, knowledge)
- Use cases (meetings, projects, async work)
- Screenshots, demos, video walkthrough
- Pricing (transparent: $149/month/board, 90-day free trial)

**Customers**:

### Tone
Professional, outcome-driven, trustworthy. Focus on results, not features.

**Examples**:
- "Your meetings keep working after everyone leaves the room"
- "An analyst for every meeting room that never forgets"
- "The workspace that gets smarter as your team uses it"

### Traffic Sources
- **Partner referrals (primary)** — Partners bring client deployments
- Direct web traffic (vibeorg.com → vibe.us)
- Paid ads (retargeting, LinkedIn)
- Content marketing (SEO, blog)
- Existing Vibe customers (firmware update on 40K boards)

### Conversion Goals
1. **Start 90-day free trial**
2. **Book demo** (for enterprise)
3. **Purchase subscription** (post-trial)
4. **Refer to partners** (for deployment help)

## Why Three Layers?

### Why not just vibe.us?

**Problem with product-first**:
- Buyers don't know the category yet ("human+agent workspace" isn't a known category)
- Positioning as "Slack with AI" or "ChatGPT for teams" is derivative
- No community or movement energy

**vibeorg.com creates the category**:
- Defines "Vibing" as a transformation, not a feature
- Builds community before product launch
- Partners rally around methodology, not product
- Media covers movement, not product

### Why not just open-vibe.org?

**Problem with OSS-first**:
- Developer community is important, but not the buyer
- No executive education (CTOs care about code, CEOs care about outcomes)
- Hard to recruit partners (partners sell outcomes, not code)

**vibeorg.com educates buyers**:
- Executives learn "why Vibe" before "how to deploy"
- Partners understand business value, not just technical value
- Movement creates top-of-funnel, OSS creates credibility

### Why vibeorg.com is core

**Category creation requires a neutral space**:
- Not product-centric (vibe.us is product)
- Not developer-centric (open-vibe.org is developers)
- Movement-centric (vibeorg.com is for everyone)

**Precedents**:
- **HubSpot**: Created "inbound marketing" category before selling product
- **Salesforce**: Created "no software" movement before selling CRM
- **Slack**: Created "where work happens" category before competing on features

| **Commercial Site** | Vibe AI Workspace | vibe.us | - |
| **GitHub Org** | OpenVibe | github.com/openvibeorg | - |

---

## Narrative Strategy

### vibeorg.com Narratives
**Primary**: Movement / Category creation
- "Vibe your organization" - What it means, why it matters
- Human+agent collaboration as new operating model
- Physical + Digital + Intelligence = Future of work
- The Vibe Framework (methodology, not product)

### open-vibe.org Narratives
**Primary**: Infrastructure / Technical
- Open source platform for human+agent collaboration
- Architecture principles, multi-model, flexible deployment
- Developer community, contribution, ecosystem

### vibe.us Narratives
**Primary**: Product / Value proposition
- The workspace that gets smarter every day
- Agents in the conversation, not outside it
- Before/after stories, ROI, outcomes

---

## Differentiation Positioning

**When asked "How are you different from [competitor]?":**

### Response Framework (Universal)

1. **First**, reinforce what we're building (not what we're NOT):
   - "We're building the workspace where humans and agents work as a team"
   - "The workspace gets smarter every day — it remembers, learns, and improves"

2. **Then**, structural differences (if needed):
   - **Open source** — Code is transparent, auditable, ownable
   - **Multi-model** — Choose Claude, GPT, Gemini, or your own models
   - **Flexible deployment** — Cloud, on-premise, hybrid
   - **Partner-led** — Deployed by advisors who know your industry

3. **Finally**, why this matters:
   - "These aren't features — they're architectural choices"
   - "We believe critical infrastructure should be open and owned by users"

**Key principle**: Lead with vision, support with differentiation. Don't lead with "we're not locked in" — lead with "this is what we're building" and differentiation follows naturally.

---

## Brand Voice & Messaging

### Across All Layers

**Do**:
- Lead with what we're building (positive, proactive)
- Use real examples and case studies
- Be specific about outcomes and value
- Emphasize learning and improvement over time
- Use "workspace" not "tool" or "platform"

**Don't**:
- Lead with competition ("we're better than X")
- Use generic AI buzzwords ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Oversell or overpromise
- Compare feature-by-feature (features converge)
- Say "AI-first" (it's "human+agent," not "AI-first")

### Layer-Specific Voice

| Layer | Voice | Example Headline |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| **Movement** | Inspirational, visionary | "Transform how your organization works" |
| **Open Source** | Technical, transparent | "Built on open protocols, runs anywhere" |
| **Commercial** | Professional, outcome-driven | "The workspace that gets smarter every day" |

---

## Visual Identity (TBD)

### Logo Usage
- **vibeorg.com**: "Vibe" wordmark (bold, inspiring)
- **open-vibe.org**: "OpenVibe" logotype (technical, clean)
- **vibe.us**: "Vibe" logo (polished, professional)

### Design System
- **Movement site**: Bold, editorial, visionary (think Medium, Stripe)
- **Open source site**: Technical, clean, docs-focused (think Tailwind CSS docs)
- **Commercial site**: Professional, polished, conversion-optimized (think Linear, Notion)

---

## Build Sequence

### Phase 1 (Month 1-3): Open Source First
**Build**: open-vibe.org
- GitHub org + initial repos
- Technical docs
- Developer community (Discord)

**Why first**: Developer community validates infrastructure. Credibility before marketing.

### Phase 2 (Month 4-6): Product Launch
**Build**: vibe.us
- Product site
- Signup flow, onboarding
- Pricing, trial

**Why second**: Product launches with OSS credibility already established.

### Phase 3 (Month 7+): Category Creation
**Build**: vibeorg.com
- Movement site
- Manifesto, methodology
- Partner directory
- Blog, newsletter

**Why third**: Movement site launches when we have traction (customer stories, partner stories). Category creation requires proof.

**Alternative**: If partner recruitment is critical early, build lightweight vibeorg.com in Phase 1 (landing page + partner application form).
