# OpenVibe GTM Quick Reference

> Everything you need to know in one page

---

## Vision

**"Vibe your organization"**

Where physical presence, digital collaboration, and AI intelligence combine.

---

## Core Thesis

**AI is becoming a participant in work, not just a tool.**

OpenVibe answers: **Where does human+agent collaboration happen?**

---

## Three-Layer Strategy

| Layer | Domain | Purpose | Audience |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Movement** | vibeorg.com | Thought leadership, community | C-suite, partners |
| **Open Source** | open-vibe.org | Technical docs, developer community | Developers, architects |
| **Commercial** | vibe.us | Product sales | Buyers, end users |

**GitHub Org**: openvibeorg

---

## Key Messaging

### For Each Layer

**vibeorg.com** (Movement):
> "Vibe your organization. Where physical presence, digital collaboration, and AI intelligence combine — the new way modern organizations work."

**open-vibe.org** (Technical):
> "Open infrastructure for human+agent collaboration. Built on open protocols, runs anywhere, integrates everything."

**vibe.us** (Commercial):
> "Vibe AI Workspace. The workspace where your team and AI work together. Gets smarter every day."

## Core Properties

1. **Agent in the conversation** - @mention to invoke, not external tool
2. **Workspace gets smarter** - Context accumulates, feedback shapes behavior
3. **Agent output worth reading** - Quality bar for everything

---

## Differentiation (4 Pillars)

1. **Open Source** - Transparent, auditable, ownable code
2. **Multi-Model** - Claude, GPT, Gemini, or your own models
3. **Flexible Deployment** - Cloud, on-premise, hybrid, edge
4. **Partner Ecosystem** - Distributed through trusted advisors

**Why this matters**: Critical infrastructure should be open and owned by users.

---

## Response Framework

**When asked "How are you different from [competitor]?":**

1. **First**, what we're building:
   - "We're building the workspace for human+agent collaboration"
   - "Where AI is a team member, and the workspace learns over time"

2. **Then**, structural differences:
   - Open source, multi-model, flexible deployment, partner-led

3. **Finally**, why it matters:
   - "These aren't features — they're architectural choices"
   - "We believe critical infrastructure should be open"

**Don't lead with competition.** Lead with vision.
