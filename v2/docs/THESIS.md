## Vision

**Vibe your organization.**

The workspace where humans and agents work as a team.

Where physical presence, digital collaboration, and AI intelligence combine — the new way modern organizations work.

---

## Thesis

**AI is becoming a colleague, not just a tool.**

The transition is happening now: from passively invoked to proactively contributing. From stateless to stateful. From individual assistant to team member.

What's missing is not smarter AI. What's missing is **where** humans and agents work together — the medium that serves both, accumulates context, and compounds value over time.

**The question OpenVibe answers: Where does human+agent collaboration happen?**

Not "individual AI assistance" (that's ChatGPT). Not "agent development tools" (that's LangChain). Not "AI features in existing tools" (that's Slack AI, Copilot).

**The workspace** where humans and agents collaborate as a team. That's OpenVibe.

---

## The Problem

Current tools serve one side, not both:

| Tool | Built For | Missing |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Slack / Teams | Human-to-human | Agents are second-class (no identity, memory, or feedback loop) |
| ChatGPT / Claude | Human-to-AI (1:1) | No team context, no collaboration, resets every session |
| Copilot / Cursor | Developer productivity | No team awareness, no organizational context |
| LangChain / CrewAI | Agent developers | No human interface, no organizational layer |

**No workspace exists where humans and agents are both first-class participants.**

The result: copy-paste shuttle. Human discusses on Slack → copies to ChatGPT → AI responds → human copies back to Slack → teammate copies to their ChatGPT → repeat. Context is lost at every boundary. Every session starts from zero.

---

## What This Medium Requires

The workspace needs to serve three participants:

### For Agents (Protocol)

How agents join, act, learn, and work:
- **Identity**: SOUL defines role, principles, constraints
- **Autonomy**: Trust levels define what agents can do without approval
- **Memory**: Feedback and corrections persist across sessions
- **Tools**: Access to external systems (code, data, calendar, etc.)

### For Humans (Interface)

How humans direct, see, control, and judge:
- **Direct**: @mention to invoke, request deep dives, give corrections
- **See**: Progressive disclosure (headline → summary → full), transparency ("why did it do this?")
- **Control**: Edit trust levels, configure SOUL, approve/reject actions
- **Judge**: Thumbs up/down, inline corrections, accept/reject outputs

### For Both (Shared Space)

Where humans and agents coexist, and value compounds:
- **Persistent context**: Conversations, decisions, knowledge accumulate
- **Knowledge pipeline**: Conversations → Deep Dives → Publish → Pin to Knowledge
- **The flywheel**: Better context → Better output → More knowledge → Better context
- **Cross-workspace learning**: Patterns from one workspace inform others (respecting trust boundaries)

---

## Core Properties

Three structural properties. If any fails, the product fails.

### 1. Agent is in the conversation

Not outside it, not in a sidebar. @mention = invocation. If it's faster to open a ChatGPT tab, we've lost.

The medium must be where both humans and agents naturally exist.

### 2. The workspace gets smarter over time

Day 1: Agent is OK.
Day 30: Agent remembers your corrections.
Day 90: Agent knows your team's decisions, preferences, context.

This is what ChatGPT can never do — it starts from zero each time. The medium compounds value.

### 3. Agent output is worth reading

If output is mediocre, the product has no reason to exist.

Progressive disclosure, structured output, feedback-shaped behavior — all serve this quality bar. Not a property of the medium, but the execution standard.

---

## Differentiation

Why OpenVibe, not Anthropic Cowork or Microsoft Copilot?

Not product features (features converge). **Structural choices** that competitors can't or won't replicate.

### 1. Open Infrastructure

**What**:
- **Open source**: Code is transparent, auditable, forkable
- **Multi-model**: Choose Claude, GPT, Gemini, or open-source models
- **Flexible deployment**: Cloud, self-hosted, on-premise, hybrid
- **Data sovereignty**: You own the data, you control where it lives

**Why it matters**:
Critical infrastructure should be open and owned by users, not locked to a vendor.

**Why competitors won't do it**:
- Anthropic Cowork: Proprietary model + platform (business model depends on lock-in)
- Microsoft Copilot: Closed ecosystem, cloud-only, Microsoft servers
- Slack AI: Proprietary, Slack-only

**Defense**: Not code secrecy, but distribution speed + ecosystem + execution quality.

### 2. Partner Ecosystem

**What**:
- Distributed through trusted advisors (consulting, accounting, MSPs)
- Industry-specific deployments (partner knows your business)
- 120+ certified partners bringing 11,500+ workspaces

**Why it matters**:
Deployed by people who know your industry, not generic SaaS sales.

**Why competitors won't do it**:
- Anthropic Cowork: DNA is direct-to-consumer/enterprise
- Microsoft Copilot: Direct sales through Microsoft account teams
- Slack AI: Direct sales, no channel conflict appetite

**Defense**: Partner ecosystem moat (trained, certified, revenue-dependent).

## Kill Signals

If any become true, the thesis is falsified:

### Product Thesis

1. **No agents deployed after 4 weeks** → Nobody wants agents in workspace
2. **>40% outputs rated unhelpful** → Output quality insufficient
3. **Users prefer ChatGPT tab** → The medium isn't better
4. **Acceptance rate doesn't improve over time** → Property 2 ("workspace gets smarter") broken
5. **Anthropic/OpenAI ships team workspace** → Gap closes from above

### GTM Thesis (Partner-Led)

6. **Partners sign up but don't deploy** → <5 deployments/partner after 6 months
7. **Partners prefer Microsoft** → Risk-averse firms choose "safe" over "better"
8. **Partner churn >15% annually** → Partners don't see value
9. **Direct sales outperforms partner** → After 12 months, partner-sourced revenue <30%

## What This Is

OpenVibe is a **workspace** designed for human+agent collaboration:

- **The workspace** where humans and agents work together, not a tool humans use to access AI
- **The platform** that gets smarter over time, not stateless sessions that reset
- **The infrastructure** built on open foundations (open source, multi-model, flexible deployment)
- **The ecosystem** distributed through partners who bring domain expertise

What we're NOT building:
- Model provider (we integrate models, not create them)
- Agent development framework (we provide the workspace, not the SDK)
- Chat app with AI features (AI is first-class participant, not a plugin)
- Compliance-first governance software (trust enables collaboration, not restricts it)
