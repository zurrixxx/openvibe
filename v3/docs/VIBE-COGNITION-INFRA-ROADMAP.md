**Workflow 7: Automated Onboarding**

```
New customer signs up
  ↓
Onboarding Agent:
  Day 1:
    - Welcome email (personalized)
    - Setup checklist (based on use case)
    - Video walkthrough (customized to industry)

  Day 3:
    - Feature introduction #1 (most relevant feature)
    - Best practice guide

  Day 7:
    - Feature introduction #2
    - Check-in: "How's it going?"

  Day 14:
    - Advanced features
    - Success metrics (show progress)

  Day 30:

    - Upsell opportunity (if relevant)
  ↓
If stuck at any stage:
  → Proactive Outreach Agent reaches out
  → Escalate to human CS if needed
  ↓
Output: 95% successful onboarding (vs 70% current)
```

**Workflow 8: Proactive Health Monitoring**

```
Health Monitoring Agent (runs daily):
  ↓
For each customer, track:
  - Usage frequency (daily/weekly/monthly active)
  - Feature adoption (which features used)
  - Engagement (logins, time spent)
  - Sentiment (from support tickets, feedback)
  ↓
Calculate health score (0-100)
  ↓
If score drops below threshold:
  → Alert CS team
  → Proactive Outreach Agent reaches out:
      "Hey, noticed you haven't logged in this week.
       Everything okay? Anything we can help with?"
  ↓
If no response or issue persists:
  → Human CS lead calls
  ↓
Output: Churn predicted 30 days in advance (vs 0 days current)
```

**Workflow 9: Expansion Identification**

```
Expansion Agent (runs weekly):
  ↓
For each customer, analyze:
  - Usage growth (are they growing?)
  - Feature limits (hitting any limits?)
  - Team size (expanding team?)
  - Use case expansion (using more features?)
  ↓
Identify expansion signals:
  - "Customer X hitting user limit (8/10 seats)"
  - "Customer Y using advanced features (upgrade candidate)"
  - "Customer Z team grew 50% (expansion opportunity)"
  ↓
For each signal:
  → Draft expansion proposal
  → Calculate ROI for customer
  → Human CS reviews and sends
  ↓
Output: 3x expansion opportunities identified (vs manual guessing)
```

## Resource Requirements

### Human Team (Throughout)

| Role | Count | Responsibility |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **CMO** | 1 | Orchestrate marketing agents, strategy |
| **Sales Lead** | 1 | Close high-value deals, train sales agents |
| **CS Lead** | 2 | Handle escalations, manage CS agents |
| **Product Architect** | 2-3 | Design products, orchestrate dev agents |
| **AI Orchestrator** | 1 | Manage agent infrastructure, optimization |

**Total humans: 7-8 (vs 30+ without agents)**

---

### Infrastructure

| Component | Purpose | Cost (est) |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Agent orchestration platform** | Coordinate all agents | Build (OpenVibe platform itself) |
| **LLM API credits** | Power agents (Claude/GPT-4) | $5-10K/month |

| **Monitoring** | Agent performance tracking | $200/month |

**Total infra cost: $6-11K/month**

**ROI:**
- Without agents: 30 people × $100K/year = $3M/year
- With agents: 8 people × $150K/year + $132K/year infra = $1.33M/year
- **Savings: $1.67M/year (56% cost reduction)**
- **But output: 10-25x more (not just cost savings, capability unlock)**

---

## Decision Points & Validation

### Month 2 (Early Signal)

**Metrics:**
- Leads: 2x?
- Qualified leads: 5x?
- Content volume: 10x?

---

### Month 4 (Phase 1 Validation)

**Metrics:**
- Leads: 10x?
- Qualified leads: 25x?
- Deals closed: 10x+?

**Decision:**
- ✅ If yes → Phase 1 success, start Phase 2

---

### Month 8 (Phase 2 Validation)

**Metrics:**
- Customer capacity: 10x?
- Churn: -50%?
- NRR: 120%+?

**Decision:**
- ✅ If yes → Phase 2 success, start Phase 3

---

### Month 12 (Full Validation)

**Metrics:**
- Revenue: 25-50x?

- → Sell transformation to other companies

---

## What This Proves

**If successful, this proves:**

1. ✅ **Cognition becomes infrastructure**
   - Vibe transformed from 30-person team → 8-person team + agents
   - Output: 10-50x more
   - Cost: 56% less
   - **Paradigm shift validated**

2. ✅ **Previously impossible → Now possible**
   - Before: Can't personalize for 100 segments (人力不够)
   - After: 100 segments simultaneously (agents 并行)

3. ✅ **Org structure fundamentally changes**
   - Before: Marketers, Sales reps, CS reps (doers)
   - After: Strategists + Orchestrators (humans) + Agents (executors)

4. ✅ **Living proof point**
   - Vibe = example of future organization
   - "We transformed ourselves 25-50x, now we sell the infrastructure"

5. ✅ **OpenVibe product validated**
   - Platform: Agent orchestration infrastructure (proven by dogfood)
   - Playbooks: Marketing/Sales/CS/Product playbooks (extracted from Vibe)
   - GTM: "We use it ourselves, here's the result"

---

## Next Steps (Week 1)
