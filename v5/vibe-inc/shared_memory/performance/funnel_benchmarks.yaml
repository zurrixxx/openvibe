# Key findings (agent context)
findings:
  - "TOF works (5-16% engaged rate). MOF is broken (0-1% 200s+ rate)."
  - "Retargeting sends 97% back to Board PDP — same page they already bounced from."
  - "Organic return is 8x more efficient than retargeting (3.2% vs 0.4% 200s+ rate)."
  - "LinkedIn retargeting: 13K visitors, 0 orders. Should be paused."
  - "Lead definition is broken: Lead = form submit (5s), NOT intent signal. 98.3% of cold leads never reach 200s+."
  - "94% of paid orders come from brand search / Shopping (Purchase Intent stage)."
  - "Board ACOS historical 18-20%. Cost per Opportunity up 35-40%."
