# Vibe Inc on OpenVibe

Vibe Inc uses OpenVibe as its internal operating layer for GTM and product development. The workspace runs seven roles across two teams: a GTM team (Revenue, Content, Customer Success, Market Intelligence) and a product development team (Product Ops, Engineering Ops, QA).

**Goal:** Replace execution-layer work in marketing, sales operations, and product management with AI roles, achieving 10-25x efficiency gains on repeatable workflows while keeping humans in the loop for decisions and external communications.

**Role configs:** `config/roles.yaml`
**Workspace identity:** `config/soul.yaml`
**Platform tenant:** `vibe-inc`
