# Phase 1.5: BDD Implementation Plan

> **Updated 2026-02-08:** Terminology changed from Fork/Resolve to Deep Dive/Publish per PRODUCT-CORE-REFRAME.md

> Status: Complete | Researcher: implementation-planner | Date: 2026-02-07

> **REFRAME NOTICE:** Gherkin scenarios use "fork/resolve" language in some sections. When implementing, use "deep dive" /
> "publish" for user-facing features. Scenario intent is unchanged — the mechanism (side-context → AI summary
> → main thread) is correct. See [`PRODUCT-CORE-REFRAME.md`](../../design/PRODUCT-CORE-REFRAME.md).

## Research Question

How should the OpenVibe MVP be decomposed into testable behavior specifications (BDD/Gherkin) that enable incremental implementation, where each step produces a working (if incomplete) system? What is the critical path, sprint plan, and testing strategy for 1-2 developers building a dogfood-ready product in 8 weeks?

    Given I am in a fork "Pricing Research" in thread "Q2 Strategy"
    And the fork was created from a message about pricing models
    And there are 3 prior messages in the fork

  Scenario: Agent sees fork context + parent thread context
    When I type "@researcher compare per-seat vs usage-based pricing"
    And I press Enter
    Then the agent should generate a response based on:
      | Context Source      | What's Included                        |
      | Parent thread       | Messages up to the fork point          |
      | Fork messages       | All 3 prior messages + my new message  |
      | System prompt       | Agent's configured system prompt       |

  Scenario: Agent response stays in fork
    When the agent responds
    Then the response should appear only in the fork
    And it should NOT appear in the main thread
    And other thread participants should only see fork sidebar activity
```

#### Feature 5.4: Agent Response with Progressive Disclosure

```gherkin
Feature: Progressive Disclosure of Agent Responses
  As a workspace member
  I want agent responses to show a summary first
  So that I can choose how deep to read

  Scenario: Agent response shows summary by default
    Given an agent has responded with a long analysis (>500 words)
    Then the response should render with:
      | Layer    | Visibility        | Content                        |
      | Headline | Always visible    | Single-line summary            |
      | Summary  | Expanded by default in fork, collapsed in main | 3-5 bullet points |
      | Full     | Collapsed         | Complete output                |
    And I should see a "Show more" toggle for the full output

  Scenario: Expand full output
    Given an agent response with collapsed full output
    When I click "Show more"
    Then the full output should expand below the summary
    And I should see a "Show less" toggle

  Scenario: Short agent responses show fully
    Given an agent response with fewer than 100 words
    Then the response should display in full without progressive disclosure

  Scenario: Resolution summary shows headline in main thread
    Given a fork was resolved with a summary
    When I view the resolution in the main thread
    Then I should see the headline and summary
    And I should see a "View full research (N messages)" link
    When I click the link
    Then I should navigate to the resolved fork view
```

#### Feature 5.5: Agent "Thinking" Indicator

```gherkin
Feature: Agent Thinking Indicator
  As a workspace member
  I want to see when an agent is processing my request
  So that I know a response is coming

  Scenario: Thinking indicator shows while agent processes
    Given I have sent a message with @mention to an agent
    When the task status changes to "running"
    Then I should see an indicator showing the agent's avatar
    And it should display "Agent is thinking..."
    And it should have a subtle animation (pulsing dots or similar)

  Scenario: Thinking indicator disappears on completion
    Given the agent thinking indicator is showing
    When the agent's response message appears
    Then the thinking indicator should disappear

  Scenario: Thinking indicator shows on error
    Given the agent thinking indicator is showing
    When the agent task fails
    Then the indicator should be replaced with an error message
    And the error should say "Agent encountered an error. Try again?"

  Scenario: Multiple agents thinking simultaneously
    Given I have @mentioned two agents in a fork
    When both agents are processing
    Then I should see two thinking indicators
    And each should show the respective agent's name
```

### Epic 6: Search

#### Feature 6.1: Search Messages Across Workspace

```gherkin
Feature: Workspace Search
  As a workspace member
  I want to search messages across the entire workspace
  So that I can find past discussions and decisions

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as "alice@vibe.dev"
    And the workspace has messages across multiple channels and threads

  Scenario: Search for a keyword
    When I open the search interface
    And I type "rate limiting" in the search box
    And I press Enter
    Then I should see search results containing "rate limiting"
    And each result should show:
      | Field      | Example                                    |
      | Content    | Message text with "rate limiting" highlighted |
      | Author     | alice@vibe.dev                               |
      | Location   | #engineering > Rate Limiting Discussion       |
      | Timestamp  | 2 hours ago                                  |
    And results should be ordered by relevance

  Scenario: Click search result navigates to message
    Given I have search results for "rate limiting"
    When I click on a search result
    Then I should be navigated to the thread containing that message
    And the message should be highlighted or scrolled into view

  Scenario: Search finds messages in forks
    Given a fork contains a message about "rate limiting"
    When I search for "rate limiting"
    Then the fork message should appear in search results
    And the location should indicate it is from a fork

  Scenario: Search with no results
    When I search for "xyznonexistentterm123"
    Then I should see "No results found for 'xyznonexistentterm123'"

  Scenario: Search handles empty query
    When I submit an empty search query
    Then no search should be performed
```

#### Feature 6.2: Search Within a Channel

```gherkin
Feature: Channel-Scoped Search
  As a workspace member
  I want to search within a specific channel
  So that I can find discussions in a particular context

  Background:
    Given I am logged in and viewing channel "#engineering"

  Scenario: Search scoped to current channel
    When I open search within "#engineering"
    And I search for "deployment"
    Then results should only include messages from "#engineering"
    And results should NOT include messages from other channels

  Scenario: Channel filter in search results
    When I search workspace-wide for "deployment"
    Then I should see a filter to narrow results by channel
    When I select "#engineering" filter
    Then only "#engineering" results should be shown
```

---

### Epic 7: Admin Config

#### Feature 7.1: Load Workspace Config

```gherkin
Feature: Load Workspace Config
  As a workspace admin
  I want to configure the workspace via settings
  So that the workspace behavior matches our team's needs

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as admin of workspace "Vibe Team"

  Scenario: Default workspace config on creation
    Given the workspace was just created
    Then the following defaults should be active:
      | Config Key          | Default Value                              |
      | sidebar_layout      | channels first, then agents                |
      | theme               | system (follows OS preference)             |
      | max_forks_per_thread| 7                                          |
      | default_agent       | assistant                                  |

  Scenario: Update workspace config
    When I go to workspace settings
    And I change "max_forks_per_thread" to 5
    And I save the config
    Then the config should be updated
    And all workspace members should see the new fork limit

  Scenario: Agent roster configuration
    When I go to agent settings
    Then I should see the list of configured agents:
      | Name       | Model             | Status |
      | @assistant | claude-sonnet-4-5 | Active |
      | @coder     | claude-sonnet-4-5 | Active |
      | @researcher| claude-opus-4-6   | Active |
    And I should be able to edit agent system prompts
    And I should be able to activate/deactivate agents
```

#### Feature 7.2: Config Affects UI Rendering

```gherkin
Feature: Config-Driven UI
  As a workspace member
  I want the UI to reflect workspace configuration
  So that the interface matches our team's setup

  Scenario: Agent roster reflects config
    Given the admin has deactivated "@coder"
    When I type "@" in a message input
    Then the autocomplete should NOT show "@coder"
    And only active agents should be suggested

  Scenario: Fork limit enforced
    Given the workspace config sets max_forks_per_thread to 5
    And a thread already has 5 active forks
    When I try to create a new fork
    Then I should see a message "Maximum active forks reached (5). Resolve or abandon an existing fork first."

  Scenario: Sidebar layout matches config
    Given the workspace config sets sidebar_layout to "agents first"
    Then the sidebar should show the agent list above the channel list
```

### Critical Path

The critical path (longest dependency chain) is:

```
Milestone 0 -> 1.1/1.2 (Auth) -> 1.3 (Workspace) -> 2.1 (Channels)
-> 2.2 (Messages) -> 2.3 (Realtime) -> 3.1-3.3 (Threads)
-> 4.1 (Fork) -> 4.2 (Work in Fork) -> 5.1-5.3 (Agent Integration)
-> 4.3 (Resolve Fork with AI Summary)
```

**The "it works" criteria at each step:**

| Step | Testable Behavior | "It Works" Criteria |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Milestone 0 | App deploys, DB connects | `npm run build` passes, Vercel preview URL loads |
| Auth (1.1-1.2) | User can sign up and log in | Sign up with email, log out, log back in |
| Workspace (1.3) | User creates workspace | After signup, workspace exists with default channels |
| Channels (2.1) | User creates a channel | New channel appears in sidebar for all members |
| Messages (2.2) | User posts a message | Message appears, persists across refresh |
| Realtime (2.3) | Two users see messages in real-time | Open two browser tabs, message in one appears in other |
| Threads (3.1-3.3) | User replies to a message | Thread panel opens, replies appear |
| Fork (4.1) | User forks from a message | Fork appears in sidebar |
| Work in Fork (4.2) | User posts in fork | Messages appear within fork context |
| Agent (5.1-5.3) | Agent responds to @mention | Type `@assistant hello`, get response |
| Resolve (4.3) | Fork resolves with AI summary | Summary posted to main thread |

---

## 3. Sprint Plan

### Sprint 0 (Pre-Sprint, 2-3 days): Milestone 0

**Goal:** Deployable empty shell with CI/CD.

**Work:**
- Nx monorepo setup with Next.js App Router application
- Supabase project creation (database, auth, realtime configured)
- Database migration: all 10 tables + RLS policies + indexes
- Seed data: default workspace, 4 channels (#general, #random, #engineering, #product), 3 agent configs
- tRPC scaffold (routers with placeholder procedures)
- Vercel deployment connected to GitHub
- GitHub Actions CI: lint + typecheck + build
- Environment variables configured

**Testable:** `https://openvibe-preview.vercel.app` loads a blank page. Database tables exist. CI passes.

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] Vercel preview deployment accessible
- [ ] All 10 DB tables created with correct constraints
- [ ] RLS policies enabled
- [ ] Supabase Realtime enabled on messages, forks, tasks, threads
- [ ] Seed data present in database

---

### Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation + Basic Messaging

**Goal:** Users can sign up, create/join a workspace, and send messages in channels. Two users can see each other's messages in real-time.

**Features Implemented:**
- Feature 1.1: User Signup
- Feature 1.2: User Login
- Feature 1.3: Workspace Creation
- Feature 1.4: Workspace Invitation (basic -- invite link, not email)
- Feature 2.1: Channel Creation
- Feature 2.2: Post a Message
- Feature 2.3: Real-Time Messages
- Feature 2.4: Message Rendering (markdown basics)

**What a demo looks like:**
1. Open app in browser -> see login page
2. Sign up with Google -> redirected to workspace creation
3. Create "Vibe Team" -> see #general channel with sidebar
4. Post a message in #general -> message appears immediately
5. Open a second browser/tab -> log in as different user
6. Both users see each other's messages in real-time
7. Messages render with markdown (bold, code blocks, lists)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All Feature 1.1-1.4 scenarios pass
- [ ] All Feature 2.1-2.4 scenarios pass
- [ ] Two concurrent users can exchange messages in real-time
- [ ] Messages persist across page refresh
- [ ] Channel sidebar shows all channels
- [ ] Auth redirects work (login, signup, OAuth callback, logout)

**Risk/Blocker Watch:**
- Supabase Auth + Google OAuth configuration can be fiddly. Budget an extra half-day.
- Supabase Realtime requires correct publication setup. Test early.
- Message rendering: use a proven markdown library (react-markdown + remark-gfm). Do not build custom renderer.

---

### Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): Threads + Basic Agent Integration

**Goal:** Thread-based conversations work. @mention an agent, get a response. This is where OpenVibe becomes more than a basic chat.

**Features Implemented:**
- Feature 3.1: Reply to a Message (Thread Creation)
- Feature 3.2: Thread Panel View
- Feature 3.3: Multi-Participant Threads
- Feature 5.1: @mention an Agent
- Feature 5.2: Agent Responds in Thread
- Feature 5.5: Agent "Thinking" Indicator

**What a demo looks like:**
1. Click on a message -> thread panel opens on the right
2. Reply in the thread -> reply appears for both users
3. Thread list shows reply count and participant avatars
4. Type `@assistant what is rate limiting?` -> agent thinking indicator appears
5. Agent responds with formatted markdown -> response appears in thread
6. Other users see the agent response in real-time

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All Feature 3.1-3.3 scenarios pass
- [ ] All Feature 5.1-5.2, 5.5 scenarios pass
- [ ] Thread panel opens/closes correctly
- [ ] Agent @mention autocomplete works
- [ ] Agent responses appear with distinct styling
- [ ] Agent thinking indicator shows/hides correctly
- [ ] Agent task lifecycle (queued -> running -> completed/failed) tracked in database

**Risk/Blocker Watch:**
- Anthropic API integration: ensure API key is set up, streaming works. Test with a simple "hello" first.
- Agent context building: keep it simple (last 50 messages). Do not over-engineer context management.
- Thread panel layout: the Discord-like side panel is the trickiest frontend component. Use a proven resizable panel library.

---

### Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): Forks + Fork Resolution (The Differentiator)

**Goal:** Fork/Resolve works end-to-end. This is the core product differentiator. Users can fork from any message, work with agents in forks, and resolve forks with AI-generated summaries.

**Features Implemented:**
- Feature 4.1: Fork from a Message
- Feature 4.2: Work in a Fork
- Feature 4.3: Resolve a Fork (AI Summary)
- Feature 4.4: Fork Sidebar
- Feature 4.5: Abandon a Fork
- Feature 5.3: Agent Responds in Fork
- Feature 5.4: Progressive Disclosure (basic -- expand/collapse on long responses)

**What a demo looks like:**
1. In a thread, click "Fork" on a message -> fork created, sidebar shows it
2. Work in the fork: post messages, @mention agent -> agent responds in fork
3. Fork sidebar shows: fork name, participants, message count, activity
4. Click "Resolve" -> AI generates summary -> edit headline/summary -> post to thread
5. Resolution summary appears in main thread with "View full research" link
6. Click "Abandon" on another fork -> fork disappears from active list
7. Agent responses in forks show progressive disclosure (expand/collapse for long content)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All Feature 4.1-4.5 scenarios pass
- [ ] All Feature 5.3-5.4 scenarios pass
- [ ] Fork lifecycle: active -> resolved -> abandoned
- [ ] Resolution summary quality is acceptable (test with real Vibe team conversations)
- [ ] Fork sidebar updates in real-time
- [ ] Agent in fork has correct context (parent thread + fork messages)
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation between main thread and fork works

**Risk/Blocker Watch:**
- AI summary quality is THE risk. Test the resolution prompt early with real conversations. Iterate the prompt.
- Fork context for agents: ensure the agent sees parent thread up to fork point + fork messages. Context truncation may be needed.
- Fork sidebar real-time updates: subscribe to fork table changes via Supabase Realtime.
- This is the most complex sprint. If behind schedule, defer Feature 5.4 (progressive disclosure) to Sprint 4.

---

### Sprint 4 (Weeks 7-8): Search, Config, Polish, Dogfood Prep

**Goal:** Search works. Admin config works. The product is polished enough for the Vibe team to use daily. Dogfood launch.

**Features Implemented:**
- Feature 6.1: Search Messages Across Workspace
- Feature 6.2: Search Within a Channel
- Feature 7.1: Load Workspace Config
- Feature 7.2: Config Affects UI Rendering
- Polish: loading states, error states, empty states, responsive layout

**What a demo looks like:**
1. Open search (Cmd+K) -> type "rate limiting" -> results with highlights
2. Click result -> navigate to the thread and message
3. Filter search by channel
4. Admin opens settings -> see agent roster -> toggle agent active/inactive
5. Deactivated agent no longer appears in @mention autocomplete
6. Everything has loading spinners, error messages, empty states
7. The app feels "production-quality" for 20 internal users

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All Feature 6.1-6.2 scenarios pass
- [ ] All Feature 7.1-7.2 scenarios pass
- [ ] Full-text search returns relevant results with highlights
- [ ] Admin can manage agent configs
- [ ] No blank/broken states in the UI
- [ ] Error messages are actionable
- [ ] App is deployed to production URL
- [ ] Vibe team members can sign up and start using it
- [ ] Onboarding instructions written for the team
- [ ] Default channels seeded with welcome messages

**Risk/Blocker Watch:**
- Search: PostgreSQL tsvector should work out of the box. Test with real content.
- Polish always takes longer than expected. Prioritize: error states > loading states > empty states.
- Onboarding: write a brief guide for the Vibe team. Assign a champion to answer questions.
- Config: keep the admin UI minimal. A simple settings page, not a full admin console.

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

```
            /  E2E  \          ~15 tests (Playwright)
           /  (slow)  \        Critical user flows only
          /____________\
         /              \
        / Integration    \     ~40 tests (Vitest + Supabase test DB)
       /  (medium)        \    tRPC router tests with real DB
      /____________________\
     /                      \
    /       Unit Tests       \  ~80 tests (Vitest)
   /        (fast)            \ Pure functions, Zustand stores, utils
  /__________________________\
```

**Target: ~135 total tests at dogfood launch.**

### Unit Tests (Vitest) -- ~80 tests

**What to test:**
| Area | Example Tests | Count |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Message parsing | @mention extraction, markdown detection | 8 |
| URL/slug generation | Workspace slug, channel name normalization | 5 |
| Date/time formatting | Relative timestamps ("2 min ago") | 5 |
| Zustand stores | Message store actions, fork store state transitions | 15 |
| tRPC input validation | Zod schema validation for all routers | 20 |
| Search query processing | Query sanitization, highlight extraction | 5 |
| Agent context building | Context window construction, token counting | 8 |
| Resolution prompt building | System prompt assembly for fork resolution | 5 |
| Config defaults | Default values when config is missing | 5 |
| Utility functions | Various helpers | 4 |

**Framework config:**
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    include: ['**/*.test.ts', '**/*.test.tsx'],
    exclude: ['**/e2e/**'],
    coverage: {
      reporter: ['text', 'html'],
      include: ['src/lib/**', 'src/stores/**', 'src/server/**'],
    },
  },
})
```

### Integration Tests (Vitest + Supabase) -- ~40 tests

**What to test:**
| Area | Example Tests | Count |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Auth router | Session retrieval, sign out | 3 |
| Workspace router | Create, update, list members, invite | 5 |
| Channel router | List, create, get, update, delete | 5 |
| Thread router | List, get, create, update status | 4 |
| Fork router | Create, resolve, abandon, list | 5 |
| Message router | Send, list, update, delete, @mention detection | 6 |
| Agent router | List, create, update, toggle | 4 |
| Task router | Get, list, cancel | 3 |
| Search router | Full-text search, channel-scoped search | 3 |
| Config router | Get, set, list | 2 |

**Setup:**
- Use Supabase local development (Docker) for integration tests
- Each test file gets a fresh database state (truncate tables in beforeEach)
- Tests call tRPC procedures directly (no HTTP, no network)

```typescript
// Example integration test
import { createCaller } from '@/server/trpc/router'
import { createTestContext } from '@/test/helpers'

describe('message.send', () => {
  let caller: ReturnType<typeof createCaller>

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const ctx = await createTestContext({ user: 'alice' })
    caller = createCaller(ctx)
  })

  it('creates a message and detects @mentions', async () => {
    const result = await caller.message.send({
      threadId: 'thread-1',
      content: '@assistant what is rate limiting?',
    })

    expect(result.content).toContain('@assistant')
    // Verify task was created for the @mention
    const tasks = await caller.task.list({ status: 'queued' })
    expect(tasks).toHaveLength(1)
    expect(tasks[0].agent_config_id).toBeDefined()
  })
})
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright) -- ~15 tests

**What to test (critical user flows only):**

| # | Flow | Steps | Priority |
|---|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Sign up and see workspace | Signup -> create workspace -> see #general | P0 |
| 2 | Log in and post message | Login -> navigate to channel -> send message -> see it | P0 |
| 3 | Real-time messaging | Two browser contexts, message in one appears in other | P0 |
| 4 | Thread creation and reply | Click message -> thread panel -> reply -> see reply | P0 |
| 5 | @mention agent and get response | Type @assistant -> send -> see thinking -> see response | P0 |
| 6 | Create a fork | Click Fork on message -> fork created -> sidebar shows it | P0 |
| 7 | Work in a fork | Navigate to fork -> post message -> message appears | P0 |
| 8 | Resolve a fork | In fork -> Resolve -> edit summary -> post to thread | P0 |
| 9 | Abandon a fork | In fork -> Abandon -> fork removed from active list | P1 |
| 10 | Search messages | Open search -> type query -> see results -> click result | P1 |
| 11 | Agent response in fork | In fork -> @mention agent -> response appears in fork | P1 |
| 12 | Fork sidebar real-time | Create fork in one tab -> appears in other tab's sidebar | P1 |
| 13 | Admin toggle agent | Settings -> deactivate agent -> agent not in autocomplete | P2 |
| 14 | Google OAuth flow | Click Google sign-in -> complete OAuth -> see workspace | P2 |
| 15 | Progressive disclosure | Agent long response -> summary shown -> expand full output | P2 |

**Framework config:**
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test'

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
  fullyParallel: false, // Sequential to avoid state conflicts
  retries: 1,
  workers: 1,
  reporter: 'html',
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
  ],
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: true,
  },
})
```

### What NOT to Test for Dogfood

| Skip | Why |
|------|-----|
| Edge cases for 100+ concurrent users | Dogfood is 20 users |
| Load/stress testing | Supabase free tier handles 20 users easily |
| Mobile responsiveness tests | Desktop-only for dogfood |
| Accessibility (a11y) compliance | Important but not blocking dogfood |
| Browser compatibility beyond Chrome | Vibe team uses Chrome |
| Offline behavior | Internet always available |
| Email delivery (invitation emails) | Using invite links, not emails |
| Rate limiting/abuse | Trusted internal users |
| Data export/GDPR | Internal tool, no external users |
| Multi-workspace scenarios | Single workspace for dogfood |
| File upload testing | Deferred feature |
| Notification delivery | No notification system in MVP |

### Test-per-Sprint Plan

| Sprint | Unit Tests Added | Integration Tests Added | E2E Tests Added | Total |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Sprint 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Sprint 1 | 25 (validation, stores, utils) | 15 (auth, workspace, channel, message routers) | 4 (#1-4: signup, login, messaging, real-time) | 44 |
| Sprint 2 | 20 (agent context, mention parsing) | 10 (thread, agent, task routers) | 3 (#4-5, plus thread E2E) | 77 |
| Sprint 3 | 25 (fork logic, resolution prompt, progressive disclosure) | 10 (fork router, resolution flow) | 5 (#6-8, #11-12: fork flows) | 117 |
| Sprint 4 | 10 (search, config) | 5 (search, config routers) | 3 (#9-10, #13: search, admin) | 135 |

## 5. Incremental Delivery

### Deployment after Each Sprint

Every sprint produces a deployable version on the production URL.

| Sprint | Deployed Version | What Users Can Do | Internal Testing? |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Sprint 0 | v0.0.1 | Nothing (empty shell) | Dev-only |
| Sprint 1 | v0.1.0 | Sign up, create channels, post messages, see real-time updates | **Yes -- basic chat.** Invite 2-3 team members for early feedback. |
| Sprint 2 | v0.2.0 | + Threads, agent @mentions, AI responses | **Yes -- threaded chat + AI.** This is where it gets interesting. Invite 5-8 team members. |
| Sprint 3 | v0.3.0 | + Forks, resolve with AI summary, fork sidebar | **Yes -- the differentiator.** This is the product thesis being tested. Expand to full 20-person team. |
| Sprint 4 | v1.0.0 | + Search, admin config, polish | **Full dogfood launch.** Replace Slack for internal use. |

### When Is It Usable Enough for Internal Testing?

**Sprint 1 (Week 2):** Usable as a basic chat tool for 2-3 early adopters. Not a Slack replacement yet, but validates auth, channels, and messaging.

**Sprint 2 (Week 4):** Usable as a team chat tool with AI. This is the minimum viable product that is meaningfully different from Slack. Threads + agent responses make it compelling for technical discussions.

**Sprint 3 (Week 6):** The product thesis is testable. Fork/Resolve is the differentiator. If the Vibe team uses forks and finds the resolution summaries useful, the product works. If they don't fork, the thesis needs revision.

**Sprint 4 (Week 8):** Dogfood-ready. The full 20-person team can use it as their primary collaboration tool for at least some use cases. Slack may still be needed for DMs, notifications, and external integrations.

### Rollback Strategy

Each sprint is a tagged release. If a sprint introduces a breaking issue:
1. Revert to the previous sprint's tag: `git checkout v0.x.0`
2. Redeploy: Vercel auto-deploys from the tag
3. Fix forward in the next sprint

No database rollback mechanism in MVP (append-only data model makes this less risky). If a migration breaks, manual SQL fix via Supabase dashboard.

## 6. Technical Milestones

### Milestone 0: Infrastructure Ready (Sprint 0, Days 1-3)

**Criteria:**
- [ ] Nx monorepo with Next.js app compiles and deploys
- [ ] Supabase project created with all tables, RLS, and Realtime
- [ ] tRPC router scaffold exists (empty procedures)
- [ ] Vercel deployment works (preview + production)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI passes (lint + typecheck + build)
- [ ] Environment variables configured in Vercel
- [ ] Local development setup documented (README)

**How to verify:** Visit the Vercel URL. See a blank page (or placeholder). Check Supabase dashboard: tables exist, Realtime is enabled.

### Milestone 1: First Message Stored and Displayed in Real-Time (Sprint 1, Week 2)

**Criteria:**
- [ ] User can sign up, log in, and see channels
- [ ] User can post a message in a channel
- [ ] Message is stored in Supabase `messages` table
- [ ] Message appears in the UI without page refresh (Supabase Realtime)
- [ ] Second user in a different browser tab sees the message appear

**How to verify:**
```
1. Open two browser tabs
2. Log in as alice in tab 1, bob in tab 2
3. Both navigate to #general
4. Alice types "Hello Bob" -> message appears in Alice's view
5. Bob's view updates to show "Hello Bob" within 1 second
```

**This is the single most important milestone.** Everything else builds on top of real-time messaging.

### Milestone 2: First Agent Response (Sprint 2, Week 4)

**Criteria:**
- [ ] User types `@assistant hello` in a thread
- [ ] A task is created in the `tasks` table with status "queued"
- [ ] The agent worker picks up the task, calls Claude API
- [ ] A response message appears in the thread with agent styling
- [ ] The task status is updated to "completed" with token usage recorded

**How to verify:**
```
1. In a thread, type "@assistant what is the capital of France?"
2. See "Agent is thinking..." indicator
3. See response: "The capital of France is Paris."
4. Response has agent avatar and distinct styling
5. Check tasks table: status = 'completed', token_usage populated
```

### Milestone 3: First Fork Created and Resolved (Sprint 3, Week 6)

**Criteria:**
- [ ] User clicks "Fork" on a message -> fork is created
- [ ] Fork appears in the sidebar with name and status
- [ ] User posts messages in the fork
- [ ] User @mentions agent in fork -> agent responds with fork + parent context
- [ ] User clicks "Resolve" -> AI generates summary
- [ ] User edits summary -> posts to parent thread
- [ ] Resolution message appears in main thread for all participants
- [ ] Fork status changes to "resolved"

**How to verify:**
```
1. In a thread, click Fork on a message about "API design"
2. Fork created: "API Design Research" appears in sidebar
3. In fork: "@researcher compare REST vs GraphQL"
4. Agent responds with analysis (using fork + thread context)
5. Click "Resolve" -> see AI summary
6. Edit headline -> click "Post to Thread"
7. Summary appears in main thread: "REST recommended for our use case..."
8. Fork sidebar shows "Resolved"
```

**This milestone validates the core product thesis.** If the resolution summary is useful and the fork flow is natural, the product works.

### Milestone 4: Dogfood Launch (Sprint 4, Week 8)

**Criteria:**
- [ ] All 7 Epics have their core scenarios passing
- [ ] Search returns relevant results
- [ ] Admin can configure agents
- [ ] No blank/broken UI states
- [ ] App deployed to production URL
- [ ] All 20 Vibe team members have accounts
- [ ] Default channels exist: #general, #engineering, #product, #random
- [ ] 3 agents configured: @assistant, @coder, @researcher
- [ ] Brief onboarding guide shared with team
- [ ] Token usage monitoring in place (SQL query)

**How to verify:** The Vibe team uses OpenVibe for at least one real discussion topic per day for a week. Track: messages sent, threads created, forks created, forks resolved, agent invocations. If fork usage is zero after 1 week, the product thesis needs revisiting.

## Open Questions

### 1. Playwright-BDD vs Plain Playwright for E2E

Should E2E tests use the Gherkin specs directly (via `playwright-bdd` library) or keep Playwright tests as plain TypeScript that mirrors the Gherkin scenarios?

**Recommendation:** Plain Playwright for MVP. The `playwright-bdd` library adds a layer of indirection (step definitions, feature file parsing) that slows down a 1-2 person team. Write Playwright tests that follow the Gherkin structure (use scenario names as test names) but don't require the Cucumber runtime. Revisit when the team grows and non-developers need to read test specs.

### 2. Supabase Local Dev vs Cloud for Integration Tests

Should integration tests run against Supabase local (Docker) or a dedicated cloud test project?

**Recommendation:** Supabase local for CI (deterministic, fast, free). Supabase cloud test project for manual testing. Use `supabase start` in CI to spin up a local instance. Seed it with test data before each test run.

### 3. AI Summary Quality Testing

How do we test that resolution summaries are "good enough"?

**Recommendation:** Do not automate summary quality testing for MVP. Instead:
- Manually test the resolution prompt with 5 real Vibe team Slack conversations.
- Iterate the prompt until summaries are consistently useful.
- During dogfood, collect thumbs-up/thumbs-down on summaries.
- Build a small set of "golden" test conversations with expected summaries for regression testing (Sprint 3+).

### 4. Test Data Management

How to manage test data across unit, integration, and E2E tests?

**Recommendation:**
- **Unit tests:** No external data. Use factories/fixtures inline.
- **Integration tests:** Seed database in `beforeEach`, truncate in `afterEach`. Use a `createTestData()` helper.
- **E2E tests:** Seed via API calls in `beforeAll` (use tRPC caller or Supabase admin client). Clean up in `afterAll`.

### 5. When to Start Writing Tests

**Recommendation:** Write tests starting in Sprint 1, not retroactively. For each feature:
1. Write the Gherkin spec (already done in this document)
2. Implement the feature
3. Write unit + integration tests for the backend (tRPC procedures)
4. Write E2E test for the critical flow
5. Move to next feature

This is not strict TDD (tests before code) because the specs already define behavior. It is "BDD-guided development" -- the specs exist before implementation, tests are written alongside or immediately after.

### 6. Progressive Disclosure Complexity

Feature 5.4 (Progressive Disclosure) requires the agent to generate structured output (headline + summary + full). Should this be:
- (A) Agent generates structured JSON, frontend renders layers
- (B) Agent generates markdown, frontend parses sections
- (C) Separate post-processing step generates summary from full output

**Recommendation:** (C) for MVP. The agent generates a full response. A separate Haiku call generates the headline and summary from the full response. This decouples agent output from presentation. The cost is one extra Haiku call per agent response (~$0.001), negligible.
