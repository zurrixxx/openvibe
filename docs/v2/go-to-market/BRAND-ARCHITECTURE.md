## Flow Between Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         vibeorg.com (Movement)                  │
│  "Inspired? Here's how to start:"               │
└────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┘
                 │
      ┌──────────┼──────────┐
      ↓          ↓          ↓
┌──────────┬──────────┬────────────┐
│ vibe.us  │open-vibe │  Partner   │
│  (Buy)   │ (Build)  │  (Deploy)  │
└──────────┴──────────┴────────────┘
```

**User Journeys**:

1. **Executive Path**: vibeorg.com → inspired → vibe.us (trial) → partner (deployment)
2. **Developer Path**: open-vibe.org → self-host → contribute → some → vibe.us (managed)
3. **Partner Path**: vibeorg.com/partners → apply → certified → deploy for clients (vibe.us)

## Narrative Strategy

Each layer has its own narrative focus:

### vibeorg.com Narratives
- **Primary**: Movement / Category creation
- "Vibe your organization" - What it means, why it matters
- Human+agent collaboration as new operating model
- Physical + Digital + Intelligence = Future of work

### open-vibe.org Narratives
- **Primary**: Infrastructure / Technical
- Open source platform for human+agent collaboration
- Architecture principles, multi-model, flexible deployment
- Developer community, contribution, ecosystem

### vibe.us Narratives
- **Primary**: Product / Value proposition
- The workspace that gets smarter every day
- Agents in the conversation, not outside it
- Before/after stories, ROI, outcomes

---

## Differentiation Positioning

**When asked "How are you different from [competitor]?":**

### Response Framework

1. **First**, reinforce what OpenVibe does (not what it's NOT):
   - "We're building the workspace for human+agent collaboration"
   - "Where AI is a team member, and the workspace learns over time"

2. **Then**, point to structural differences (if needed):
   - "We're open source — you own the code and data"
   - "Multi-model — choose the right AI for each task"
   - "Flexible deployment — cloud, on-premise, or hybrid"
   - "Partner-led — deployed by advisors who know your industry"

3. **Finally**, explain why this matters:
   - "These aren't just features — they're architectural choices"
   - "We believe critical infrastructure should be open and owned by users"

**Key principle**: Lead with vision, support with differentiation. Don't lead with "we're not locked in" — lead with "this is what we're building" and differentiation follows naturally.

## Brand Voice & Messaging

### Across All Layers

**Do**:
- Lead with what we're building (positive, proactive)
- Use real examples and case studies
- Be specific about outcomes and value
- Emphasize learning and improvement over time

**Don't**:
- Lead with competition ("we're better than X")
- Use generic AI buzzwords ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Oversell or overpromise
- Compare feature-by-feature (features converge)

### Layer-Specific Voice

| Layer | Voice | Example Headline |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| **Movement** | Inspirational, visionary | "Transform how your organization works" |
| **Open Source** | Technical, transparent | "Built on open protocols, runs anywhere" |
| **Commercial** | Professional, outcome-driven | "The workspace that gets smarter every day" |
