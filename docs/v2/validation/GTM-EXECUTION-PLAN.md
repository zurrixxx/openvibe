## 1. Customer Acquisition Strategy

### 1.1 Partner Acquisition (Primary Channel)

**Target**: 120 partners in 18 months across 4 verticals

#### Partner Verticals & Sequencing

| Phase | Vertical | Target | Timeline | Why This Order |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Phase 1 | Management Consulting | 10 firms | Month 1-6 | Existing Vibe relationships, strategic buyers |
| Phase 2 | Accounting Firms | 20 firms | Month 7-12 | Highest client density (200+ clients/firm), recurring advisory relationships |
| Phase 3 | MSPs | 40 firms | Month 13-18 | Tech-forward, strong lock-in, recurring revenue model |
| Phase 4 | Marketing Agencies | 50 firms | Month 19-24 | HubSpot-validated playbook, content-driven |

**Phase 1 is co-development** — partners shape the deployment methodology, not just customers.

#### Lead Generation Tactics

**1. Warm Outreach (Primary for Month 1-6)**

Target: Existing Vibe board customers in professional services
- Current Vibe customers: ~500 consulting/accounting firms with boards
- Approach: "We're building the AI layer for your Vibe boards. Want to co-develop?"
- Value prop: Early access, co-design deployment methodology, wholesale pricing lock-in

**Execution**:
- Week 1: Segment Vibe CRM for firms with 20+ client relationships
- Week 2-4: Direct outreach from CEO/VP Sales (10 meetings/week target)
- Month 2: First 3 partners signed (co-development partners)

**2. LinkedIn Outreach (Ongoing)**

Target: Partner decision-makers at target firms
- Consulting: Managing Partners, Innovation/Tech leads
- Accounting: Advisory Services leads, CAS practice leaders
- MSPs: Sales/Partnership Directors
- Agencies: Client Services leads, Strategy Directors

**Execution**:
- Build target lists: 500 contacts per vertical (2,000 total)
- Cadence: Connection request → wait 3 days → personalized message → case study → call
- Message framework: "Your clients are asking about AI in meetings. Here's how [Firm X] is deploying it."
- Target: 10% response rate = 200 qualified conversations

**Tools**: LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Outreach.io (sequencing), Clay.com (enrichment)

**3. Industry Events (Quarter-driven)**

Target: Partner recruitment + end customer awareness

**Year 1 Events**:
- Q2: Consulting Summit (co-sponsor with Vibe)
- Q3: Accounting Tech Summit (booth + speaking)
- Q4: MSP Expo (channel partner track)

**Execution per event**:
- Pre-event: Target list → LinkedIn outreach → meeting scheduler
- At event: 1:1 meetings (20+ scheduled), booth demos, speaking session
- Post-event: 48-hour follow-up → demo → partner pitch
- Target: 5-10 partner sign-ups per major event

**4. Content Marketing (Builds over time)**

**Phase 1 (Month 1-6)**: Partner-focused
- Partner case studies: "How [Firm X] deployed OpenVibe for 30 clients"
- Revenue calculator: Show partners recurring revenue potential
- Deployment methodology white paper

**Phase 2 (Month 7-12)**: End customer evidence
- ROI case studies from Alpha/Beta customers
- "AI Workspace for [Vertical]" guides
- Analyst reports (if available)

**Distribution**:
- LinkedIn posts (3x/week)
- Industry publications (1 article/month)
- Partner co-marketing (joint webinars)

#### Partner Qualification Criteria

Before investing in partner enablement, qualify against:

| Criterion | Threshold | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Client base size | 20+ active clients | Need scale to justify enablement |
| Vertical fit | Consulting, Accounting, MSP, Agency | Product-market fit validated |
| Tech capacity | Deploys software for clients | Ability to onboard/train |
| Revenue potential | $50K+ ARR within 12 months | ROI on partner enablement |
| Cultural fit | Innovation-focused, client advisory | Will champion new solutions |

**Qualification process**:
1. Initial call (30 min): Understand practice, client base, current tech stack
2. Discovery call (60 min): Demo product, discuss client use cases, assess fit
3. Pilot proposal: 3 internal uses + 3 client pilots (90 days)
4. Decision: Sign partner agreement or decline

**Disqualifiers**:
- Pure resellers (no client advisory relationship)
- Firms with <10 active clients
- Competing product relationships (e.g., Microsoft Copilot exclusive)

#### Partner Value Proposition

**To the partner firm**:

**Revenue Opportunity**:
- Wholesale pricing: Buy at $79-99/board, sell at $149-199/board
- Recurring revenue: $60-120/board/month margin
- Example: 50 clients × 3 boards × $60 margin = **$9,000/month recurring** ($108K/year)

**Client Value**:
- Differentiation: "We bring AI to your team collaboration"
- Stickiness: Becomes part of client advisory relationship
- Expansion: Natural upsell in existing engagements

**Competitive Advantage**:
- Early mover: "We're certified OpenVibe partners" (before market saturates)
- Industry-specific: Deploy vertical-tuned agent configurations
- Open infrastructure: Not locked to single model/vendor

**Partner Enablement Included**:
- Training & certification (online + live)
- Sales playbook & demo kit
- Co-marketing materials (co-branded)
- Hands-on support for first 5 deployments
- Partner portal with resources

### 1.2 Direct Acquisition (Secondary Channel)

**Target**: 1,600-2,400 boards (direct) by Month 12

Direct acquisition supports partner channel (not competes with it). Focus: **end customers who don't have consulting relationships** (small teams, tech-forward orgs).

#### Lead Generation Channels

**1. Website & SEO (Organic)**

**Target pages**:
- Home: vibeorg.com (updated with AI workspace focus)
- Product: open-vibe.org (open source + commercial)
- Blog: Content marketing hub

**SEO strategy**:
- Primary keywords: "AI workspace," "human agent collaboration," "team AI assistant"
- Long-tail: "AI for consulting teams," "meeting room AI," "agent management platform"
- Technical: Optimize for "open source AI workspace" (developer audience)

**Content cadence**:
- Blog: 2 posts/week (how-to, case studies, thought leadership)
- Docs: Comprehensive documentation (drives developer traffic)
- Changelog: Weekly product updates (community engagement)

**Target**: 5,000 monthly visitors by Month 6 → 15,000 by Month 12

**2. Paid Acquisition**

**Budget allocation** (informed by Unit Economics CAC target - placeholder):
- LinkedIn: 50% ($25K/month by Month 6)
- Google Search: 30% ($15K/month)
- Industry pubs: 20% ($10K/month)

**LinkedIn Campaigns**:
- Audience: Decision-makers at 50-500 person companies (consulting, tech, finance)
- Creative: Case studies, demo videos, ROI calculator
- Offer: 90-day free trial (no credit card)
- Target: $150 CAC (within LTV:CAC range)

**Google Search**:
- High-intent keywords: "AI meeting room software," "team AI assistant," "collaborative AI workspace"
- Landing pages: Use case-specific (consulting, tech, finance)
- Offer: Free trial + demo

**Industry Publications**:
- Consulting Magazine, Accounting Today, MSP Today
- Format: Thought leadership + sponsored content
- Goal: Credibility + partner recruitment

**3. Community & Open Source (Long-term)**

**Open source strategy**:
- GitHub: Open-core model (community edition free, commercial features paid)
- Documentation: Comprehensive, developer-friendly
- Community: Discord/Slack for developers

**Funnel**:
- Developers try community edition → Need commercial features → Upgrade
- Organic advocacy: Developers recommend to their companies
- Contributor pipeline: Community contributors → hiring pool

**Target**: 1,000 GitHub stars by Month 12, 50 active contributors

**4. Events & Webinars**

**Webinars** (monthly):
- Month 3: "AI Workspace 101: How Consulting Firms Use OpenVibe"
- Month 6: "Case Study: [Partner Firm] Deployed AI for 30 Clients"
- Month 9: "Open Source AI: Why Infrastructure Matters"

**Conferences**:
- Q2-Q4: 3-5 mid-tier conferences (not mega-events)
- Focus: Speaking + booth (not just booth)
- Target: 20+ qualified leads per event

#### Direct Sales Funnel

```
Website Visit → Sign Up (Trial) → Activation → Conversion → Expansion

Conversion rates (industry benchmarks, to be validated):
- Visit → Sign Up: 2-3%
- Sign Up → Activation: 40-50% (within 7 days)
- Trial → Paid: 15-25% (90-day trial)

Example (Month 12):
- 15,000 monthly visitors
- 450 trial sign-ups
- 225 activated users
- 56 paid conversions
- ~$8K MRR direct (recurring)
```

**Key insight**: Direct channel is **lead gen for partners**. If small team signs up but needs deployment support → refer to certified partner.

#### Acquisition Summary

| Channel | Role | Metric | Target (Month 12) |
|---------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Partner acquisition | Primary revenue | Partner sign-ups | 30 partners |
| Partner-sourced customers | Primary revenue | Client deployments | 600+ customers |
| Direct acquisition | Secondary revenue + partner leads | Paid customers | 100-150 direct |
| Open source | Long-term moat | Community size | 1,000 stars, 50 contributors |

### 2.2 End Customer Sales Cycle (via Partner)

**Overview**: 30-120 days from partner introduction to paid conversion

#### Stage 1: Partner Introduction → Client Interest

**Duration**: 7-14 days

**Activities**:
1. Partner identifies opportunity
   - Existing client engagement (consulting project, advisory retainer)
   - Client pain: Meeting overload, collaboration friction, no AI strategy
2. Partner introduces OpenVibe
   - Context: "We're deploying AI workspaces for clients. Here's how it works."
   - Format: 15-min intro in existing meeting (not separate sales call)
3. Client expresses interest
   - Wants to learn more
   - Agrees to demo

**Owner**: Partner (with OpenVibe co-sell support if needed)

**Exit criteria**: Client agrees to demo

#### Stage 2: Client Interest → Trial Start

**Duration**: 14-21 days

**Activities**:
1. Discovery call (partner-led)
   - Understand: Team structure, current tools, pain points
   - Tailor: Use cases relevant to client's business
2. Demo (partner-led or co-sell)
   - Show: Agent in conversation, progressive disclosure, feedback loop
   - Emphasize: "Workspace gets smarter over time" (not just features)
3. Trial proposal
   - 90-day free trial (no credit card)
   - Onboarding support from partner
   - Check-ins at Day 30, 60, 90
4. Sign-up
   - Client creates workspace
   - Partner configures agents (SOUL, integrations)

**Owner**: Partner (OpenVibe supports if needed)

**Exit criteria**: Client trial started, onboarding complete

**Common failure points**:
- Procurement delays → Emphasize free trial (no contract yet)
- IT security review → Provide security docs, SOC 2 (when available)
- Client doesn't see urgency → Partner articulates business case

#### Stage 3: Trial → Paid Conversion

**Duration**: 90 days

**Activities**:
1. **Week 1-2: Onboarding**
   - Partner trains client team
   - Agent configuration (SOUL, integrations)
   - First @mentions and deep dives
2. **Day 30: First check-in**
   - Review: Usage metrics (@mentions, acceptance rate, deep dives)
   - Address: Any friction points
   - Optimize: Agent configurations if needed
3. **Day 60: Mid-trial check-in**
   - Review: Acceptance rate delta (improving = good signal)
   - Collect: Feedback (what's working, what's not)
   - Plan: Expansion (more agents, more boards)
4. **Day 75: Conversion discussion**
   - Partner initiates: "Trial ends in 15 days. Let's discuss going live."
   - Present: Pricing ($149/month/board)
   - Handle: Objections (see Section 3.2)
5. **Day 85: Decision point**
   - Client commits to paid or churns
   - If committed: Contract + billing setup
   - If not: Offboarding or extended trial (case-by-case)

**Owner**: Partner (OpenVibe monitors, supports if needed)

**Exit criteria**: Client converts to paid or churns

**Target conversion rate**: 15-25% (industry benchmark for 90-day trial)

**Success signals**:
- @mentions per user per day > 2
- Acceptance rate improving over time (M3 vs M1)
- Deep dives published (> 30% publish rate)
- "Would miss it if gone" > 60% (if surveyed)

**Churn signals**:
- @mentions declining after Week 2
- Acceptance rate not improving or declining
- No deep dives or published knowledge
- Users revert to ChatGPT/Slack

### 2.3 Direct Customer Sales Cycle (Self-Serve)

**Overview**: 0-90 days (trial-driven, low-touch)

**Funnel**:
1. Website visit → Sign up (instant)
2. Self-serve onboarding (email sequence + in-app guidance)
3. Trial (90 days)
4. Convert or churn

**Key difference from partner-led**: No human in the loop until conversion decision.

**Sales involvement**: Only if customer requests (inbound demo request, high-value account).

**Conversion tactics**:
- Day 7: "Getting started" email (if not activated)
- Day 30: Check-in email (usage summary, tips)
- Day 60: "You're halfway through trial" (case studies, ROI calculator)
- Day 75: "Trial ends soon" (pricing, conversion CTA)
- Day 85: "Last chance" (urgency, discount if needed)

**Target conversion rate**: 15-25% (same as partner-led, but lower touch)

#### Partner Pitch Framework

**Context**: Partner is pitching OpenVibe to their client (not cold call, part of existing relationship).

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes

**Format**: Conversation (not formal presentation unless client prefers)

**Structure**:

**1. Context Setting (2 min)**
"We've been exploring how AI is changing team collaboration. You mentioned your team spends hours in meetings but struggles to capture decisions. We've been working with OpenVibe — it's an AI workspace designed for teams like yours."

**2. The Problem (3 min)**
"Here's what we're seeing: Teams use Slack for discussion, ChatGPT for AI help, and Google Docs for notes. But context is lost at every boundary. Every AI session starts from zero."

**Ask**: "Does this resonate with your team?"

**3. The Solution (5 min)**
"OpenVibe is different. It's a workspace where humans and AI work together — agents are in the conversation, not outside it. The workspace remembers context, learns from your corrections, and gets smarter over time."

**Demo** (if live):
- Show: @mention an agent in a conversation
- Show: Progressive disclosure (headline → summary → full)
- Show: Feedback loop (thumbs up/down, corrections persist)

**4. The Opportunity (5 min)**
"We're deploying this for clients as part of our advisory work. It's especially powerful for [vertical-specific use case]."

**Examples**:
- Consulting: "Client engagement workspaces get smarter with each project"
- Accounting: "Client advisory teams have AI that knows your client's context"
- Tech: "Engineering teams have agents that understand your codebase"

**5. Next Steps (2 min)**
"We recommend a 90-day trial. No cost, no commitment. We'll set up the workspace, configure the agents, and train your team. After 90 days, you decide if it's worth $149/month per board."

**Ask**: "Want to try it?"

**Common objections** (see Section 3.2 for full guide):
- "We already use ChatGPT" → "This is for teams, not individuals. Context compounds."
- "We use Microsoft Copilot" → "Different problem. Copilot is in your tools, OpenVibe is where your team works."
- "We're not ready for AI" → "That's why we're doing this together. You don't need to figure it out alone."

### 3.2 End Customer Sales Playbook (Partner-Led)

**Context**: Customer is in trial (partner-led). This playbook covers trial management and conversion.

#### Trial Management Process

**Day 1-7: Onboarding**

**Partner actions**:
1. Welcome email to client
   - Workspace URL + login instructions
   - Getting started guide (5 min read)
   - Schedule: Onboarding call (30 min)
2. Onboarding call
   - Tour workspace: Channels, agents, integrations
   - First @mention: Demo agent response
   - Assign homework: Each team member @mentions agent once by end of week
3. Day 3 check-in (async)
   - Email: "How's it going? Any questions?"
   - Offer: Drop-in support hours (30 min)

**Success criteria (Day 7)**:
- All team members logged in
- 10+ @mentions across team
- No blockers

**Day 8-30: Activation**

**Partner actions**:
1. Weekly async check-in (email)
   - "How's the team using OpenVibe? Any surprises?"
   - Share tip: "Try a deep dive on [topic relevant to client]"
2. Day 30 call (30 min)
   - Review usage metrics
   - Ask: "What's working? What's not?"
   - Collect feedback: Specific pain points, feature requests
3. Optimize configuration
   - Adjust SOUL if agents too passive/aggressive
   - Add integrations if needed (Slack, Google Docs, etc.)

**Success criteria (Day 30)**:
- @mentions per user per day > 1 (target: 2+)
- Acceptance rate > 60%
- At least 1 deep dive published
- Team says: "We're starting to see value"

**Day 31-60: Habit Formation**

**Partner actions**:
1. Bi-weekly check-ins (async + 1 call)
2. Day 60 call (30 min)
   - Review: Acceptance rate delta (M2 vs M1)
   - If improving: "Great, workspace is learning"
   - If flat/declining: "Let's troubleshoot"
3. Share case study
   - "Here's how [Other Client] is using it"
   - Inspire: New use cases

**Success criteria (Day 60)**:
- @mentions per user per day > 2
- Acceptance rate improving (even 5% = good signal)
- 3+ deep dives published
- Knowledge base growing

**Day 61-90: Conversion Prep**

**Partner actions**:
1. Day 75 call (30 min) — **Conversion discussion**
   - "Trial ends in 15 days. Let's talk about going live."
   - Present pricing: $149/month/board
   - ROI framing: "How many hours of meeting follow-up is this saving per week?"
2. Handle objections (see below)
3. Day 85: Decision deadline
   - "We need a decision by Day 90. Paid or we pause the workspace."
   - Urgency: Real (not artificial)

**Success criteria (Day 90)**:
- Client converts to paid OR
- Client churns (learn why) OR
- Extended trial (case-by-case, max 30 days)

#### Objection Handling Guide

**Objection 1: "We already use ChatGPT"**

**Response**:
"That's great — ChatGPT is excellent for individual work. OpenVibe is for teams. The difference: ChatGPT resets every session, OpenVibe remembers. Your team's context, decisions, and corrections compound over time. Think of it as the team's memory, not just an assistant."

**Reframe**: Individual AI vs. team AI.

---

**Objection 2: "We use Microsoft Copilot"**

**Response**:
"Copilot is in your tools — Word, Excel, Teams. OpenVibe is where your team works. Copilot helps you write a document; OpenVibe helps your team make a decision. Different problems."

**Reframe**: Tool AI vs. workspace AI.

---

**Objection 3: "We're not ready for AI"**

**Response**:
"That's exactly why we're here. You don't have to figure this out alone — we're deploying it for you, training your team, and supporting you through the trial. By Day 90, you'll know if it works for your team. No risk."

**Reframe**: "Not ready" = "Need help," and that's what partners provide.

---

**Objection 4: "Too expensive"**

**Response**:
"$149/month/board is less than the cost of one hour of meeting follow-up per week. If your team saves 2 hours/week on meeting notes, action items, and context sharing, that's $100+ in value for a $35/week investment."

**Reframe**: Cost vs. value (ROI framing).

**If still objecting**: Offer volume discount (see Section 6.2).

---

**Objection 5: "Security concerns"**

**Response**:
"We take security seriously. OpenVibe supports self-hosted deployment (your data never leaves your infrastructure), SSO integration, and role-based access control. We're also working toward SOC 2 compliance [timeline]. Happy to connect you with our security team."

**Reframe**: Security is a feature, not a barrier.

---

**Objection 6: "We need more time"**

**Response**:
"I understand. What would help you make a decision? More usage? Specific use case validation? Executive buy-in?"

**Diagnose**: Real objection or stalling?

**If real**: Address specific concern (extend trial if justified).

**If stalling**: Create urgency ("Trial ends Day 90, we need to know by then").

---

**Objection 7: "We want to try [Competitor]"**

**Response**:
"That's fair — you should evaluate options. Here's what makes OpenVibe different: [1] Open source + multi-model (not locked to vendor), [2] Partner-deployed (we're here to support you, not just sell software), [3] Workspace gets smarter over time (feedback loop)."

**If they insist**: "No problem. When you're ready, we're here."

**Reframe**: Differentiation without bashing competitor.

---

### 3.3 Direct Sales Playbook (Self-Serve + Sales-Assist)

**Self-Serve Path** (90% of direct customers):
- Customer signs up → Self-onboarding → Trial → Convert or churn
- No human in loop unless customer requests

**Sales-Assist Path** (10% of direct customers):
- High-value account (50+ users) OR
- Inbound demo request OR
- Enterprise inquiry (security, compliance, custom deployment)

**When to engage sales**:
- Customer requests demo (inbound)
- Account score > threshold (50+ users, tech vertical, high intent)
- Stalled trial (Day 30, low usage, worth saving)

**Sales-Assist Process**:
1. Discovery call (30 min)
   - Understand: Use case, team size, tech stack
   - Qualify: Good fit for OpenVibe? Self-serve or partner referral?
2. Demo (30-45 min)
   - Tailored to use case
   - Show: Agent in conversation, feedback loop, knowledge accumulation
3. Trial support
   - Check-in at Day 30, 60 (if high-value)
   - Address friction points
4. Conversion
   - Pricing discussion (Day 75-85)
   - Close or churn

**Referral to partner**:
- If customer needs deployment support → Introduce certified partner
- If customer in specific vertical (consulting, accounting) → Partner better fit

---

## 6. Pricing & Discounts

### 6.1 Standard Pricing

**End Customer Pricing** (Direct or via Partner):
- $149/month/board (announced publicly)
- 90-day free trial (no credit card required)
- Monthly billing (no annual commitment required, but incentivized)

**Partner Wholesale Pricing**:
- $79-99/month/board (partner buys from OpenVibe)
- Partner margin: $60-120/board/month (depending on resale price)
- Partners set their own retail price: $149-199/board recommended

**Why wholesale model (not revenue share)**:
- Simpler: Partner buys, partner sells, partner keeps margin
- Predictable: OpenVibe revenue is $79-99/board regardless of partner's markup
- Aligned: Partner incentivized to sell more (higher volume = higher revenue)

**Volume Tiers** (for partners):
- 1-50 boards: $99/board
- 51-100 boards: $89/board
- 101-500 boards: $79/board
- 500+ boards: Custom (negotiated)

**Example Partner Economics**:
- Partner with 50 clients × 3 boards = 150 boards
- Wholesale cost: $89 × 150 = $13,350/month
- Resale at $149: $149 × 150 = $22,350/month
- Partner margin: $9,000/month ($108K/year)

### 6.2 Discount Policy

**When to Discount**:
1. Volume commitments (see 6.2.1)
2. Annual prepay (see 6.2.2)
3. Early partner incentives (see 6.2.3)
4. Competitive displacement (case-by-case, requires approval)

**When NOT to Discount**:
- During free trial (already free)
- Direct customers below $149/board (damages pricing perception)
- "Just asking for a discount" (no justification)

#### 6.2.1 Volume Discounts (End Customers)

**Trigger**: Customer commits to 10+ boards

| Boards | Discount | Monthly Price per Board |
|--------|----------|------------------------|
| 1-9 | 0% | $149 |
| 10-50 | 10% | $134 |
| 51-100 | 15% | $127 |
| 101-500 | 20% | $119 |
| 500+ | Custom | Negotiated (enterprise) |

**Approval**:
- 10-100 boards: Sales Manager approval
- 101-500 boards: VP Sales approval
- 500+ boards: Executive approval (custom contract)

**Terms**:
- Volume commitment for 12 months (minimum)
- Discount applies if commitment maintained
- If customer drops below threshold, price reverts to standard tier

**Example**:
- Customer commits to 50 boards × $134 = $6,700/month ($80K/year)
- If customer drops to 30 boards → Price reverts to $134 (still in 10-50 tier)
- If customer drops to 8 boards → Price reverts to $149

#### 6.2.2 Annual Prepay Discount

**Trigger**: Customer pays annually (upfront)

**Discount**: 15% (equivalent to 2 months free)

**Example**:
- Monthly price: $149/board × 12 = $1,788/year
- Annual prepay: $1,520/year (15% off)
- Savings: $268/year per board

**Can stack with volume discount**:
- 50 boards × $134 (volume discount) × 12 = $80,400
- Annual prepay (15% off): $68,340
- Savings: $12,060

**Terms**:
- Non-refundable after 30 days
- Auto-renews at same price (price lock for renewals)

**Approval**: Sales Manager

#### 6.2.3 Early Partner Incentives

**Trigger**: First 10 partners who sign by Month 6

**Incentive**:
- Wholesale price locked at $79/board (regardless of volume)
- For 2 years (24 months)
- After 2 years, standard volume tiers apply

**Why**: Reward early partners for taking risk during Alpha/Beta.

**Terms**:
- Must deploy to 20+ clients within 12 months (or incentive revoked)
- Must maintain good standing (revenue current, support responsive)

**Approval**: VP Sales or CEO

#### 6.2.4 Promotional Discounts (Launch)

**Trigger**: GA launch (Month 6)

**Offer**: First 100 direct customers (not partner-sourced)
- 20% off first 6 months ($119/board instead of $149)
- After 6 months, price reverts to $149

**Why**: Create urgency for GA launch, build customer base quickly.

**Terms**:
- Limited to first 100 sign-ups (scarcity)
- Cannot stack with other discounts
- After 6 months, customer can cancel or continue at $149

**Approval**: Marketing (pre-approved for launch)

#### 6.2.5 Competitive Displacement

**Trigger**: Customer switching from competitor (Microsoft Copilot, Slack AI, etc.)

**Discount**: Up to 25% off for first 12 months (case-by-case)

**Justification required**:
- Proof of current competitor contract
- Committed switch to OpenVibe (not just testing)
- Customer willing to be case study/reference

**Approval**: VP Sales

**Example**:
- Customer using Microsoft Copilot for 50 users ($1,500/month)
- Switching to OpenVibe: 10 boards × $149 = $1,490/month
- Discount (25%): 10 boards × $112 = $1,120/month (first year)
- Year 2: Reverts to $149 (or volume discount if applicable)

### 6.3 Discount Constraints

**Never discount below these thresholds**:
- Direct customers: $100/board/month (floor)
- Partners (wholesale): $70/board/month (floor)

**Why**: Below $100/board, LLM costs + support costs = negative margin.

**Approval for exceptions**: CEO only

**Red flags** (require VP/CEO review):
- Customer asking for >30% discount
- Partner asking for <$70/board wholesale
- Customer negotiating during free trial (they haven't used it yet)

### 6.4 Pricing Communication

**Public pricing** (on website):
- $149/month/board
- 90-day free trial
- Volume discounts available (contact sales)

**Partner pricing** (private):
- Not published publicly
- Disclosed during partner sales process
- In partner agreement (confidential)

**How to handle pricing questions**:
- Direct customer: "It's $149/month per board. We offer volume discounts for 10+ boards and annual prepay discounts. Want to see the ROI calculator?"
- Partner: "Wholesale pricing starts at $99/board for <50 boards, $89 for 51-100, $79 for 100+. You set your retail price — most partners sell at $149-199."

## 7. Key Insights

### 7.1 Partner-Led GTM is Proven (HubSpot Model)

**HubSpot precedent**: Targeted marketing agencies (not end customers). Each agency deployed HubSpot for 30-100 clients. Result: exponential growth through partners.

**OpenVibe model**: Same playbook, different vertical (consulting/accounting/MSPs instead of agencies).

**Why it works**:
- 25x faster than direct sales (partner-sourced = 93% of revenue by Month 24)
- Partners become sales force (trained, certified, revenue-dependent)
- Industry-specific deployments (partner knows customer's business)

**Key metric**: Partner-sourced revenue % (target >50% by Month 12).

### 7.2 Sales Cycle Timelines are Realistic

**Partner sales cycle**: 60-90 days (initial contact → first client deployment)
- Industry benchmark: Consulting sales cycles = 103 days average
- OpenVibe target: 60-90 days (faster due to 90-day free trial, no upfront cost)

**End customer sales cycle**: 90 days (trial period)
- Industry benchmark: B2B SaaS trial-to-paid = 15-25% at 30-90 days
- OpenVibe target: 15-25% conversion (validated in research)

**Direct sales cycle**: 0-90 days (self-serve, low-touch)
- Industry benchmark: Self-serve SaaS conversion = 15-25%
- OpenVibe target: Same (no human in loop unless requested)

### 7.3 Trial is the Wedge

**90-day free trial** is critical:
- No credit card = no procurement friction
- No contract = no legal delays
- 90 days = enough time to form habit (30 days too short for complex product)

**Research finding**: "Properly onboarded customers are 5x more likely to remain customers after the first 90 days."

**Trial success criteria** (from research):
- Day-30 retention rate > 40%
- @mentions per user per day > 2
- Acceptance rate improving over time (M3 vs M1)

**If trial fails**: Understand why (product, fit, onboarding) → Improve.

### 7.4 Partner Enablement is Make-or-Break

**Research finding**: "Time to first client deployment < 30 days" is critical success metric.

**If partner takes >90 days to deploy first client** → Wrong partner or insufficient enablement.

**Enablement must include**:
- Sales training (how to pitch, demo, handle objections)
- Technical training (how to deploy, configure, troubleshoot)
- Ongoing support (first 5 deployments with hands-on help)

**Partner Success KPI**: Client deployments per partner (target: 20+ within 12 months).

### 7.5 Content is Sales Enablement (Not Just Marketing)

**Research finding**: "Sales enablement materials should include pitch decks, brochures, and training videos to ensure partners have access to valuable resources."

**Most valuable content**:
- Partner playbook (step-by-step sales process)
- Demo script (15 min, 30 min, 60 min versions)
- Objection handling guide (with scripts)
- Case studies (partner stories + customer ROI)

**Content is not "nice to have" — it's required for partners to sell.**

### 7.6 Wholesale Pricing Model > Revenue Share

**Research finding**: "For SaaS, it makes more sense to give margin in perpetuity to incentivize the partner to retain and renew the customer year after year."

**OpenVibe model**: Wholesale ($79-99/board) → Partner sells at $149-199 → Partner keeps margin.

**Why not revenue share**:
- Complicated accounting (who tracks usage? who invoices?)
- Partner doesn't control pricing (OpenVibe sets retail price)
- Misaligned incentives (partner wants high price, OpenVibe wants volume)

**Wholesale model benefits**:
- Simple: Partner buys, partner sells
- Predictable: OpenVibe revenue is $79-99 regardless of partner's markup
- Aligned: Partner incentivized to sell more (margin scales with volume)

### 7.7 Discount Policy Prevents Margin Erosion

**Research finding**: "If you have a SaaS business model, pricing structures differ significantly from traditional software models."

**Key constraints**:
- Never discount below $100/board (direct) or $70/board (wholesale)
- Below $100/board, LLM costs + support costs = negative margin
- Discounts only for strategic reasons (volume, annual prepay, competitive displacement)

**Red flag**: Customer negotiating during trial (they haven't used it yet → No value proven).

## 8. Recommendations

### 8.1 Prioritize Partner Enablement (Not Just Recruitment)

**What**: Invest heavily in partner success (not just partner sales).

**Why**: Research shows "partners sign up but don't deploy" is a key risk. Success = deployments, not sign-ups.

**How**:
1. Hire Partner Success Manager (Month 1)
2. Build 30-60-90 day onboarding program (Month 2)
3. Hands-on support for first 5 client deployments per partner
4. Weekly check-ins during first 90 days

**Metric**: Time to first client deployment < 30 days (enforce this).

### 8.2 Build Content Before Launch (Not After)

**What**: Create partner + customer content during Alpha/Beta (Month 1-6), not during/after GA.

**Why**: Partners can't sell without materials. Customers can't self-serve without guides.

**How**:
1. Month 1-2: Partner playbook, pitch deck, revenue calculator
2. Month 3-4: Product overview, use case guides, demo video
3. Month 5-6: Partner case studies, customer ROI calculator

**Metric**: 100% of planned content delivered by Month 6 (before GA).

### 8.3 Trial is the Product Demo

**What**: Don't gate free trial behind demo/sales call (like competitors do).

**Why**: 90-day trial IS the demo. Let customers try it without friction.

**How**:
1. Sign up → instant workspace creation (no approval, no credit card)
2. Self-serve onboarding (email sequence + in-app guidance)
3. Sales only engages if customer requests or high-value account

**Metric**: Sign-up to activation time < 5 minutes.

### 8.4 Track Acceptance Rate Delta (Not Just Acceptance Rate)

**What**: Measure if acceptance rate improves over time (M3 vs M1), not just absolute rate.

**Why**: Thesis is "workspace gets smarter over time." If acceptance rate flatlines, feedback loop is broken.

**How**:
1. Instrument: Log acceptance rate per workspace per month
2. Track: Delta (M3 - M1, M6 - M3)
3. Kill signal: If delta = 0 for 6 months → Thesis falsified

**Metric**: Acceptance rate delta > 0 (even 5% improvement = good signal).

### 8.5 Co-Development (Not Just Alpha)

**What**: First 3-5 partners are co-development partners (not just Alpha customers).

**Why**: They shape the deployment methodology, not just test the product.

**How**:
1. Month 1: Recruit 3-5 partners (existing Vibe relationships)
2. Month 2-4: Work with them to define deployment process
3. Month 5: Codify deployment methodology (becomes partner playbook)

**Outcome**: Partners feel ownership (they built this), not just customers (they bought this).

### 8.6 Segment Partners by Readiness (Not Just Vertical)

**What**: Not all partners are created equal. Segment by readiness, not just vertical.

**Why**: Some partners can sell in 30 days, others need 90 days. Tailor support accordingly.

**Segments**:
1. **Fast movers** (ready to sell in 30 days): Tech-forward, already deploy SaaS for clients
2. **Learners** (60-90 days): Need more training, first time deploying AI
3. **Slow movers** (90+ days): Wrong fit or insufficient capacity → Deprioritize

**How**: Assess during qualification call → Tailor onboarding intensity.

### 8.7 Pricing Discipline (No "Let Me Check" Discounts)

**What**: Sales team must have clear discount authority (no ad-hoc discounts).

**Why**: If every deal is negotiated, pricing perception collapses.

**How**:
1. Publish discount policy (this doc, Section 6.2)
2. Sales Manager approval for 10-20% discounts
3. VP Sales approval for 20-30% discounts
4. CEO approval for >30% discounts (should be rare)

**Rule**: If you're discounting >20% routinely, price is wrong (not just negotiation).
