## Live API Testing (2026-02-20)

First real API calls validated. Credentials configured for Meta Ads + HubSpot.

| Test | Layer | Status | Time |
|------|-------|--------|------|
| HubSpot `contact_get` | Tool smoke | **PASSED** | 0.5s |
| Meta `meta_ads_read` | Tool smoke | **PASSED** | 118s |
| Meta `weekly_report` (Claude + Meta API) | Agent loop | **PASSED** | 148s |

**Issues discovered:** see `vibe-inc/shared_memory/performance/live_testing_insights.yaml`
- Meta N+1 query pattern triggers rate limit — needs account-level insights refactor
- LLM string-to-list coercion — fixed for meta_ads_read, audit needed for others

## Strategic Note: Open Source as Competitive Moat (2026-02-24)

**Trigger:** Notion 3.3 Custom Agents launched — 24/7 autonomous agents with Slack/Mail/Calendar/MCP integrations, natural language config, credit-based pricing. 21,000+ agents built in beta.

**Key insight:** Notion agents = platform-locked automation. Your data lives on their platform, workflows run in their sandbox, you pay credits for their compute. 80% of teams will find this "good enough."

**OpenVibe's differentiator is ownership:**
- Data on your infra (per-tenant data_dir)
- Workflows you define (operator/workflow/tool YAML)
- Model choice (direct SDK, not platform-wrapped)
- Agent logic transparent (LangGraph state machine, not black box)

**Open source is a must.** The 20% who need full control over data + workflows won't trust another SaaS platform — they need to self-host, fork, and audit. Open source is the only credible way to offer that. It also:
- Creates distribution without sales team
- Builds trust with technical buyers
- Lets the community extend operators/tools for platforms we don't cover
- Makes "feedback is the moat" real — contributions compound

**Notion validates the market, OpenVibe serves the segment they can't.**

### Why Open Source Wins When Code Is Easy to Write

When AI makes code trivial to produce, closed-source protects nothing — anyone can replicate your SaaS in a day. Moats shift from code to:
1. **Data** — accumulated domain knowledge, user feedback, training data
2. **Operations** — who runs it better, responds faster
3. **Community** — ecosystem richness, integrations, contributions
4. **Brand trust** — "just use theirs" in a specific domain

Closed source survives only where data network effects (Bloomberg), liability requirements (healthcare/finance), or hardware integration (Apple) justify it. For everything else, open source becomes the rational default: trust via auditability, distribution via zero-friction adoption, compounding via community.

This aligns with OpenVibe's thesis: code is open, domain knowledge + feedback loops are the moat. Notion charges credits for platform-locked compute. OpenVibe earns trust through transparency + data ownership.

### The Data Substrate Insight

The agent itself is commodity. What matters is the data substrate agents operate on. Notion's moat isn't Custom Agents — it's that they already have your docs. Slack's moat is your conversations. The agent is just a feature on top of the data.

OpenVibe's play isn't "better agent framework" (that's LangChain territory). It's:
1. **Memory as core product** — Episode/Insight/Reflect triple-layer is your data substrate. Agents are features on top.
2. **Cross-silo unification** — Notion has docs, Slack has convos, HubSpot has CRM, Meta has ads. Each SaaS does agents within its silo. OpenVibe is the unified data layer + agents that reason across all of it.
3. **Open source = open data ownership layer** — not "open source agent framework" but "own your data substrate, run your own agents on it."

### Notion as Gateway Drug — The Graduation Path

Notion agents educate the market: "agents can do things for you." But they're trigger-based automation (Level 1-2). Enterprises will graduate to wanting real autonomous decision-making.

| Level | Capability | Who |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | Trigger → summarize | Notion Custom Agents |
| 2 | Monitor → alert | Most SaaS agents |
| 3 | Analyze → recommend → human approves → execute | OpenVibe (human-in-the-loop) |
| 4 | Autonomous within guardrails | OpenVibe (target state) |

The gap between "set a trigger" and "manage a $50K budget autonomously" is where the next wave gets built. OpenVibe's architecture is already here: HumanLoopService approval chain, escalation_rules in soul.yaml, daily_optimize workflows that reallocate spend within CAC guardrails.

### Agent-Native vs Agent-Augmented

The more interesting future isn't old companies adding agents as features — it's fully agentic companies built from scratch around agent workflows. Notion adding agents to docs is agent-augmented. A company where agents ARE the workforce (with humans as supervisors/escalation) is agent-native. OpenVibe is infrastructure for agent-native companies — not "add AI to your existing workflow" but "build your company around human+agent collaboration from day one."

## Open Source Launch Plan (2026-02-24)

### Product Roadmap

**Phase 0 — Packaging (2 weeks)**
- v5 → clean open source repo, strip Vibe Inc business data
- `pip install openvibe` works
- 3 example role templates (extracted from vibe-inc, sanitized)
- Quickstart: clone → install → run demo agent → 5 minutes
- README: one sentence what + why + how

**Phase 1 — Developer Experience (month 1-2)**
- `vibe init --template <name>` one-command role creation
- Contributing guide: how to add operators, tools, role templates
- GitHub Actions CI
- 3-5 building-in-public articles (Vibe Inc real case studies)

**Phase 2 — Community (month 2-4)**
- Template contribution mechanism
- Discord / GitHub Discussions
- First external contributors submit operators (Stripe, Zendesk, QuickBooks...)
- "Vibe your first role" tutorial series

**Phase 3 — Hosted Platform (month 4-6)**
- vibe.us hosted version
- Select template → connect API keys → run
- Free tier (1 role, limited hours) → paid tier
- Vibe Inc dashboard as reference customer

### GTM Path

GitHub launch → HN "Show HN" post → building-in-public content → developer adoption → community templates → hosted platform conversion

### Business Model

| Layer | Price | Who |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Open source (self-host) | Free | Developers, technical teams |
| Hosted platform | $/agent-hour | Teams without devops |
| Enterprise (self-host + support) | Contract | Regulated industries |

### Core Metrics

- Phase 0-1: GitHub stars, clones, quickstart completion rate
- Phase 2: Contributors, templates submitted, companies using
- Phase 3: Hosted signups, conversion rate, revenue

## Not Yet Done

- **D2C Content** — D2C design has 3 roles; Growth + Strategy built, Content remaining
- **Google Ads** — credentials pending, not yet tested
- **Meta API optimization** — N+1 query pattern needs refactor (DESIGN.md §8)
- **Phase 3 gate not passed** — needs 3 Vibe Inc roles live + 1 end-to-end workflow; agent loop validated but Meta rate limit blocks repeat runs
- **Known debt** (documented in DESIGN.md §6-8):
  - Model duality: V3 RoleTemplate/RoleSpec coexists with V5 TemplateConfig/RoleInstance
  - YAML templates not connected to TemplateRegistry
  - System roles not injected into workspaces
  - Meta N+1 query pattern (§8)

## Future: Multi-Developer Readiness

When ready to onboard the team (each person/group owns a role), need to address:

1. **Role Developer Guide** — onboarding doc covering Role/Operator/Tool contract, soul writing, test patterns
2. **Tool ownership** — shared `tools/` needs per-domain ownership; shared tools (e.g. GA4) need frozen interfaces
3. **Test reorg** — flat `tests/` → per-role subdirectories
4. **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions running pytest on PRs
5. **Shared memory write protocol** — per-role namespace or ownership rules for `shared_memory/` YAML
6. **Example role template** — empty role + operator + test skeleton for new developers

## Rules

- Important milestone complete → pause for user confirmation
- No external calls without confirmation
- UI direction unclear → pause for user sketch
