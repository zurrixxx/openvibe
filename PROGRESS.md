## Current State

**Phase:** V4 — Vibe AI Adoption
**Status:** 5 operators, 22 workflows, 80 nodes. 116/116 tests passing.
**Stack:** Python 3.13, Temporal + LangGraph + Anthropic SDK (direct `call_claude()`, no CrewAI)
**Next:** T25 (smoke test with real APIs) → T26 (go live)
**Project dir:** `v4/vibe-ai-adoption/` — read its `PROGRESS.md` for implementation details
**SDK dir:** `v4/openvibe-sdk/` — **SDK V2 complete** (194/194 tests, 25 commits, v0.2.0)
**Docs:** `v4/docs/` — thesis, design, principles, proposed designs

## Version History

### V4 (Current) — Consolidated
- Merged V2 design principles + V3 thesis + V3 implementation into single source of truth
- 5 operators replace 20 flat agents. CrewAI fully removed.
- All docs in `v4/docs/`, all code in `v4/vibe-ai-adoption/`
- **SDK V1 complete** (2026-02-17): 4-layer framework at `v4/openvibe-sdk/`, 87 tests, 6 public exports
- **SDK V2 complete** (2026-02-17): Memory pyramid + authority + access control, 194 tests, 15 public exports (v0.2.0)

### V3 (Archived) — Implementation
- Built Temporal + LangGraph + CrewAI stack → then removed CrewAI
- Operator pattern: 5 operators, 22 workflows, 80 nodes, 116 tests
- Docs scattered across `v3/docs/` and `v3/vibe-ai-adoption/docs/`

### V2 (Archived) — Design & Strategy
- Thesis: AI as colleague, not tool. Workspace for human+agent collaboration.
- Design: SOUL, progressive disclosure, feedback loop, persistent context, trust levels
- Strategy: Partner-led GTM, $149/board/month (superseded by dogfood-first)
- Docs in `v2/docs/` (38 files)

### V1 (Archived) — Research & Prototype
- "AI Deep Dive" concept. Nx monorepo + Supabase + Next.js
- Validated: Resolution Prompt v2 (4.45/5), Progressive Disclosure, Context Assembly
- Docs in `v1/docs/` (48 files), implementation in `v1/implementation/`

## Session Resume Protocol

1. Read `PROGRESS.md` (this file) — where we are
2. Read `v4/docs/THESIS.md` — core thesis
3. Read `v4/vibe-ai-adoption/PROGRESS.md` — implementation status
4. Read `v4/docs/DESIGN.md` — architecture
5. Important milestones → pause for user confirmation

## Rules

- 重要阶段完成 → 暂停等用户确认
- 外发内容先确认
- UI 方向不确定时 → 暂停等用户草图
